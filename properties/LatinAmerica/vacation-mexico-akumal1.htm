				<div class="usa_title_line"></div>
			 <div class="usa_font_1 font12 h3">
				  <p align="left">There is a special  ocean location; Punta Sur. Here your spirit will soar to touch both Ocean and  Sky. Here you can escape the over development of Villas abutting the  all-inclusive hotels permeating the Riviera Maya. Here you will find privacy  and seclusion and wild ocean music. Punta Sur, in Akumal, is part of the  Riviera Maya, an hour and 15 minutes south of the Cancun airport. Situated  between Tulum, home to famous Mayan ruins and the bustling city of Playa del  Carmen, this is an ideal location for seeing the sights, snorkeling, Cave  diving at world famous Cenotes, or relaxing in this 5,500 square foot  ocean-front Villa. This newly-formed association of architect-designed private  Villas is an enclave of the most exclusive and secluded multi-million dollar  Villas directly facing the Caribbean Sea </p>
			   <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The newest luxury  villa, Akumal Luxury Beachfront I, is available for a discerning client to rent  for a few select weeks of the year. This private 4-bedroom Villa boasts a  unique architectural design and designer details seldom found in a Beach Villa.  The couple who designed Akumal Luxury Beachfront I have spent 15 years in the  Riviera Maya, and the villa reflects details from their global travels as well  as the taste of the Designer&rsquo;s former position as the Executive Director of  Takashimaya New York. </p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">Situated high on the  18 foot coral dune, the Akumal Luxury Beachfront I commands breathtaking views  of the Sea. The pool path walks you down about 20 steps to preserved coral  strata where your feet meet the Sea. This unique natural coral environmental  area pulsates with sea life. Walk the rocks from the Villa path and sandy  beaches are 100 yards on either side of you. An expert from the Akumal  Ecological Center can come to the Villa and explain the vast natural resources  literally at your feet. The natural corals and preserved landscape looks a bit  like the raw ocean action of Big Sur.</p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The Villa staff will  take care of your needs while you are on vacation. Our personal Concierge will  arrange for Chef prepared meals, Professional massages, tours of sites to see,  private Yoga instruction, Baby sitting, Fishing and Golf - all with nominal  service charges.</p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left"><strong>Villa Floor Plan:</strong><br />
                    Entering Akumal Luxury  Beachfront I, through double arched Caribbean-Hardwood doors the visitor is  immediately drawn to the spectacular view of the Ocean. The architect&rsquo;s glass  window soaring 25-feet high reveals and frames the grandeur of the ocean.  Located at the South border of Akumal, Punta Sur, is still close enough to walk  beachside into the town of Akumal, making it an ideal location. Currently there  are no immediate neighbors on either side of the Villa.</p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">Akumal Luxury  Beachfront I was designed to maximize an indoor-outdoor lifestyle. The large  glass doors open up completely to patio beds framed in rock corals for lounging  outside. Patios are roof-covered and linked to the 45 foot long mosaic tiled  infinity-edge pool. The pool boasts a large 8-person Jacuzzi tub viewing the  ocean. In the entrance foyer, the visitor sees the 6-foot tall black wrought  Iron chandelier suspended from a domed ceiling 25 feet above. </p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The hand-honed  circular stairwell is embedded with river rock and bound by a hand-hammered  artisan railing which spirals up to the roof. The first floor of the villa has  a large Living Room with three large lounging sofas arranged in a semi-circle.  Entertainment system includes a 42&rdquo; flat-screen TV with a satellite service, a  DVD player and a multi-speaker amplifier to connect an iPod. The large Dining  Rooms 9 foot wood dining table can accommodate 12 for dinner. The space is  dramatically enhanced with a candle lit enclave wall. A professional kitchen of  black granite has two sinks, a professional oven, a dishwasher, and is large  enough for everyone to see or participate in meal preparation. A Bar of lit  Amarillo Onyx graces the hallway. Outside, under the patio ceiling, there is a  Grill, and an outside Bar with three barstools made from mosaic tiles adjacent  to the infinity edge swimming pool.</p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The Library Bedroom, a  large bedroom suite, is located on the first floor and has a four-poster  Caribbean style hardwood bed. This bedroom overlooks the Caribbean Sea through  a small balcony. The en-suite bathroom has Crema Maya marble double vanity, and  an oversized shower with two rainfall shower heads. </p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
               <p align="left"><strong>Second Floor - Bedroom Description: </strong><br />
               Master Suite occupies  one entire wing of the villa, with a total living space of over 1,800 square  feet. The King Size bed is crowned with a rare fossilized hardwood tree root  from the depths of the Yucatan jungle. A lunging single-size bed is for  lounging or additional sleeping. The 360 square foot bathroom is clad floor to  ceiling in a honed off-white Mexican marble. The Master Bathroom boasts a large  6 foot round soaking tub, a separate oversized marble shower with a rainfall  showerhead. Two marble sinks capture views of both the Caribbean Sea and the  jungle sunsets with privacy. There is a large dressing area closet. This suite  opens up to an oversized private balcony with a built-in couch and Lounge  chairs, which overlooks the pool and the Caribbean Sea. This Master Suite has a  36&rdquo; flat-screen TV with satellite service.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The Caribbean Suite is  a spacious beige linen furnished suite with more than 550 square feet of living  space. The King-sized bed looks directly at the Caribbean Sea through 9&rsquo; wide  glass doors. The marble-clad bathroom has a hand-made egg-shaped tub that  protrudes into the bedroom offering stunning views of the Caribbean (all with  complete privacy) while you shower or bathe. The oversized private balcony  offers a refuge from it all with double wooden cushioned loungers and a seating  area. This Caribbean Suite has a 42&rdquo; flat-screen TV with satellite service.</p>
                  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The Jungle Suite  offers a playful accommodation for up to six children, ages seven to seventy&hellip;.  Naturally harvested tree trunks adorn the four beds in this large room. Two  double beds and two single beds. En suite, a large bathroom, double sinks and  double shower heads can accommodate a crowd. Glass doors open to a large  adjoining balcony overlooking the jungle, which has a built in double bed and  another shower, this one outdoors. Should someone wants to sleep &ldquo;outside&rdquo; but  not too far away from those inside, the staff will make up this double couch as  a bed. </p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">All four bedrooms have  air-conditioning and ceiling fans, yet due to the location with its natural sea  breezes, we expect the A/C will be seldom used at Punta Sur. All four bedrooms  have direct ocean views and very large outdoor balconies with seating areas.  Beds are made to perfection with thick pillow-top mattresses, luxury linens and  plush pillows. All bathrooms are furnished with cotton towels, soaps, shampoo,  conditioner and a hair dryer. All bedrooms have a safe deposit box for  valuables</p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="left">The second floor has a  large library shelved desk-computer area for two people. Wi-Fi service is  provided at no charge. </p>
               <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
               <p align="left"><strong>The Roof:</strong><br />
               The third floor roof  of the Villa has sheltering Palapa roofs with covered couches and an exercise  area. This space has breathtaking views of the Sea and wide angle panoramas of  the red Jungle sunsets. </p>
