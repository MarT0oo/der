        <h1 align="left">Estate Bala, Northwest coast , Mallorca, Spain Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Estate Bala, opening in Spring 2017, is a new three-bedroom private villa on the Northwest coast of Mallorca in Spain’s Balearic Islands, private estate, Estate Bala. Looking out to the deep blue of the Mediterranean Sea, this spacious villa will be perfect for a family or group of friends to take exclusively, guaranteeing the utmost experience of luxury and privacy in a spectacular setting. <br>
          <br>
          Guests won’t have to lift a finger as everything is included during a stay, from meals to airport transfers, activities and even dinner in a local restaurant, so it’s the perfect place to really switch off and enjoy being looked after in a luxurious and serene setting. Estate Bala is the third villa on Edition’s sprawling 700 acre private estate, which lies amidst breathtaking vines, citrus fruit trees, almonds and olive trees and will be the perfect place for a peaceful European getaway. Situated near charming historical towns, as well as the stunning Tramuntana mountain range, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the options for exploring the beautiful surroundings are endless. Estate Bala’s guests will also benefit from a tailored service with a private concierge, as well as a fabulous private swimming pool. <br>
          <br>
          We want your stay with us at Estate Bala to feel like a home away from home. Each villa has their own unique style and character and are guaranteed to be a relaxing and special location throughout your stay. Sa Terra Rotja with 4 Bedrooms, Sa Punta de S’Aguila with 5 bedrooms and the new villa Estate Bala with 4 Bedrooms, can all be hired exclusively.<br>
<br>
          Plenty of our guests choose to do practically nothing at all during
          their stay with us, spending time relaxing on the terraces, next to
          the pools and enjoying some time away from the everyday routine.
          If that’s not entirely to your liking there are a number of more
          energetic activities to keep you busy. <br>
          <br>
          SWIMMING <br>
          Take a dip in your private heated pool just steps away
          from your villa. Both pools are heated (as and when
          necessary) and have steps into the water. <br>
          <br>
          TENNIS <br>
          Play a spot of tennis on the court adjacent to Sa Terra
          Rotja (racquets and balls provided). The tennis court
          is shared by Sa Terra Rotja and Sa Punta de S’Aguila
          and is a 10 minute drive from the latter. If you’d like to
          perfect your serving skills we can arrange for a tennis
          coach for an additional charge. <br>
          <br>
          BEACH <br>
          The northwest Mallorcan coast is renowned for its
          pebbly beaches and coves. Son Bunyola beach is a
          small pebble beach and is enjoyed by hikers walking
          the famous coastal track from Banyalbufar to Port
          des Canonge (the little fishing village just beyond the
          estate). From Sa Punta de S’Aguila the beach is a 10
          minute walk and from Sa Terra Rotja the beach is a
          short drive or 20 minute walk. <br>
          <br>
          WALKING <br>
          Settled within the beautiful Mallorcan mountainous
          landscape, the area is perfect for hiking expeditions.
          Take a walk around the estate which is 3kmx5km in
          size, or head straight down to the coastal walk which
          starts from the pebble beach. The walk between the
          two villas is approximately 40 minutes. If you want to
          go further afield the nearest town is Banyalbufar and
          is approximately a 30 minute walk from Sa Punta de
          S’Aguila or an hour walk along the beach front from
          Sa Terra Rotja. Hiking expeditions can also be arranged. <br>
          <br>
          TABLE TENNIS <br>
          Unleash your competitive side - each villa has its own
          ping-pong table! <br>
          <br>
          CYCLING <br>
          Cycling excursions to explore Mallorca can be arranged
          during your stay. Cycling equipment is organised with
          a cycle hire company so please let us know in advance
          if you would like to do this so we can get everything
          organised. <br>
          <br>
          SPA TREATMENTS <br>
          If you would like a spa treatment during your stay
          please ask a member of the team who will be happy
          to provide a spa treatment list. Spa treatments
          are subject to availability and are available for an
          additional charge. <br>
          <br>
          GOLF <br>
          There are over 20 golf courses on the island, many of
          which are of a high standard; we can help with green
          reservations should you wish to visit one. <br>
          <br>
          SAILING <br>
          Staying on a beautiful Spanish island, it would be
          amiss not to experience a sailing trip on the tranquil
          Mediterranean waters. We can help organise sailing trips
          during your stay so simply speak to the team. <br>
          <br>
          CANOEING AND KAYAK TOURS <br>
          If you are looking for a more energetic way to explore
          the ocean waters, we can organise local canoeing and
          kayak tours. Details available on request. <br>
          <br>
          DEEP SEA FISHING <br>
          If you are in Mallorca, do not hesitate to get in contact
          with our reservations team for a spot of deep sea
          fishing. The area truly is perfect for sailing and fishing.
          Son Bunyola is located around 25 kilometres
          from the centre of Palma de Mallorca <br>
          <br>
          Visitors to the island of Mallorca typically arrive via the capital, Palma, whose airport
          is around a 40 minute drive to the estate. The island is well served by direct air
          connections from a range of European cities both by scheduled and charter airlines;
          visitors from further afield will need to connect via a European hub. <br>
          <br>
          To reach the estate we recommend hiring a car which will give you additional
          flexibility when exploring the area. We are always happy to arrange airport transfer
          and taxis. <br>
          <br>
          The traditional Mallorcan villages of Banyalbufar and Esporles are a few kilometres
          away , providing a variety of restaurants, tapas bars and other
          local amenities. </p>
