        <h1>Lough Cutra Castle, Gort, Co. Galway, Ireland Vacation Rental</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Lough Cutra Castle is a self catering private family home that can accommodate up to 17 guests in 9 luxurious bedrooms, with an additional 23 in the courtyard homes for a total of 41 guests on the estate. An exclusive but central location on Ireland's Western seaboard in Gort, Co. Galway, Lough Cutra was designed by John Nash who worked on Buckingham Palace. The estate has been privileged to host discerning guests such as His Royal Highness Prince Charles and Duchess of Cornwall Camilla, Irish President Michael D Higgins, Bob Geldof, Lady Augusta Gregory and WB Yeats. The countryside surrounding Lough Cutra holds many a story, dating back centuries. <br>
          <br>
          The castle and estate are 40 minutes from Shannon Airport. Due to its easily accessible location, Lough Cutra is ideal for family gatherings, friendly weekends away or summer holidays. We are convenient to International and European guests as well as our domestic visitors. Airport pick up and drop off can be arranged for all arriving guests, although we encourage car hire as there is much to see and do on the West Coast of Ireland. <br>
          <br>
          We pride ourselves on guaranteeing absolute privacy and the utmost discretion for our guests. Behind our secure gates, guests have to freedom to take long walks on our wooded estate, cycle through the paths, wander the gardens together, or take part in many outdoor activities organised by our in house concierge for your party. <br>
          <br>
          Our aim is to provide a unique, once in a lifetime experience for our guests. Our home is your castle and we are happy to give guidance and organise your outings, whatever your fancy. The relaxed nature of our staff and of the castle itself means that guests feel as though Lough Cutra Castle is their own home. A full-time staff of 3 is available on premise, however we can arrange additional staff should your party size require it. <br>
          <br>
          As a family home, the Castle offers a truly unique combination of relaxed formality combined with everyday living - an enchanting experience we happily extend to our castle guests. <br>
          <br>
          We have three self catering courtyard houses situated in the grounds of the Estate in South County Galway (Cormorant, Klaus, Henry's House). Part of an original conversion dating back to the 1920's the cottages offer modern facilites in a traditional setting. <br>
          <br>
          The three self catering houses are situated around a two storey courtyard built during the Great Famine of 1846. All three have been refurbished in recent years and are continually being upgraded to improve your holiday experience with us. Each of the cottages exudes character, is unique in style and furnishings, and act as an excellent base from which to explore the Galway region as well as County Clare . For those who just want to get away from it all the cottages offer peace and tranquility in a historic and relaxing setting. <br>
          <br>
          CORMORANT<br>
          <br>
          Nestled into the Northern corner of the courtyard, this beautifully appointed self catering cottage can sleep up to six guests - with private entrance and parking. Built during 1846 as part of a programme to provide famine relief during the Great Potato Famine of the time, it originally housed stabling for some of the many horses that were needed to run a large country estate such as Lough Cutra. In the 1920's the Gough family, who were the then owners of the Estate, closed up the Castle and converted several areas of the courtyard including Cormorant into a large residence for themselves. They brought with them many original features from the Castle, such as wooden panelling and oak floorboards from the main Castle dining room and marble fireplaces from the bedrooms. <br>
          <br>
          We have furnished and decorated the home to provide a luxuriously comfortable and private stay to our guests. Each unique courtyard home combines the history and heritage of the estate and buildings with modern conveniences.<br>
          <br>
          KLAUS<br>
          <br>
          Located in the South western corner of the courtyard, this self catering house can sleep 10 guests in 5 bedrooms, including a bedroom and bathroom with disabled access. The building was originally built as stables and storage for the estate, but burnt down in 1981. Out of the ashes rose a house brimming with character and quirkiness! <br>
          <br>
          Much more contemporary in internal appearance than Henry's House or Cormorant, the home has a large raised open fireplace in the living room, and a dining area surrounded by a mezzanine balcony. Klaus has been decorated and furnished in a way that suits the unique features with big bright art, comfy sofas and accentuated features. There is a personal touch to every home on the grounds at Lough Cutra, each item picked specifically to convey the character of each home. We strive to provide the combination of timeless luxury and elegance with updated, modern conveniences. <br>
          <br>
          HENRY'S HOUSE<br>
          <br>
          An original stone cottage stable for the estate, these former tack rooms for the estate's many horses were converted into a home in the 1920's. A two-story self catering house, it faces into two courtyards and can sleep up to eight guests. Strategically built with a view of the castle but a separate entrance and self parking - Henry's House is close to the gardens and gives a sense of privacy to all that stay here. The house showcases many original features, such as oak floorboards from the Castle dining room and fireplaces from the bedrooms of the Castle. We have furnished and decorated the cottage to create an enchanting experience for our guests, combining the luxury of the estate with modern conveniences. </p>
