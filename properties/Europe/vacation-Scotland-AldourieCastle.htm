        <h1 align="left">Aldourie Castle, Lochness, Scotland Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Enjoy the very best of Scottish Highland hospitality at the historic
          Aldourie Castle Estate, on the shores of fabled Loch Ness.<br />
          <br />
          This historic Castle and Estate is situated on the southern shore of
          Loch Ness, close to the city of Inverness, capital of the Scottish Highlands.
          Aldourie Castle offers grandeur and comfort, beauty and tranquillity
          in a breathtaking setting, which epitomises the timeless
          magic and heritage of Scotland.<br />
          <br />
          For a truly memorable experience, the Castle and Estate are available
          for private house parties, celebrations, product launches and other
          important occasions, on an exclusive basis <br />
          <br />
          The estate is the only habitable Castle on the shores of Loch
          Ness and has occupied this site for hundreds of years. While
          less than five miles from Inverness, the Estate seems in a world of
          its own, with an unforgettably atmospheric sense of calm and
          tranquillity that will soothe the mind and energise the spirit.<br />
          <br />
          It offers all the fairytale grandeur and glamour you could wish for
          from a Listed Grade A Highland Castle, with turrets, towers,
          nooks and crannies aplenty. This is a wonderfully authentic and
          homely place, blazing with warmth and hospitality, seducing its
          guests as much with its gorgeous interiors as with its majestic
          setting.<br />
          <br />
          The Castle has been beautifully restored, from the deepest wine
          cellar to the tip of its spires, to create a luxurious yet intimate
          home, in which the attention to heritage and period detail is
          matched by the quality and comfort of the furnishings. The
          ambience is warm and welcoming throughout the seasons, in
          the true, time-honoured style of Scottish hospitality.<br />
          <br />
          Love and attention have been lavished outdoors too, with the
          gardens and woodland also restored to the splendour of their
          19th century heyday. A winding, tree-lined drive leads to the
          Castle and a broad lawn slopes gently down to Loch Ness itself –
          a world of total peace and privacy. Guests may take cocktails on
          the Terrace, or stroll through the woods to the leafy Marina.<br />
          <br />
          As well as a formal garden, the original kitchen gardens have
          been preserved, with splendid historic greenhouses and fine shrubs
          and walkways to delight the eye. Both outside and indoors, Aldourie Castle exudes a sense of poetic history unique to a Highland
          Estate. This is a place to relax, to live well, to enjoy the company
          of friends and family – perhaps even to dream a little.<br />
          <br />
          Today, Aldourie Castle is the perfect destination for your
          exclusive private occasion. Stay for a week, or even a month, and
          enjoy the ultimate house party: the freedom of an entire Castle
          and Estate in one of the world’s most iconic locations. For a
          birthday celebration, a wedding, a business event, or just to get
          away from it all, the castle provides a magical environment.<br />
          <br />
          Tradition, opulence, classic style and total comfort – guests
          will find these qualities in abundance .
          The interiors have the grace and scale of an historic house, yet
          the intimacy and cosy warmth that dispel any notion of formality.
          From the moment you arrive, Castle Estate will relax and enchant
          you.<br />
          <br />
          Furnishings throughout the Castle are of the highest quality, with
          rich fabrics, elegant furniture and fine antiques. From the light and
          airy hall to the deep ruby of the Red Drawing Room; from the
          magnificent Dining Room to the panelled Laird’s Room, it is a
          place where the cares of the world seem far, far away.<br />
          <br />
          The Castle Estate conveys the impression that the owners departed a
          hundred years ago and that little has changed since then, so
          quintessentially Scottish has the atmosphere remained. Yet every
          interior is pristine and every amenity belongs firmly in the 21st
          century: this is a luxury home for modern times too.<br />
          <br />
          Come to stay here and immerse yourself in a book by a roaring
          log fire, or savour a drink and good conversation around the
          table; enjoy some traditional indoor pursuits or perhaps gaze
          serenely across the lawns to the beauty of Loch Ness and the
          Highland landscape beyond.<br />
          <br />
          There are fifteen bedrooms at the Castle, ranging from
          grand four-posters, swathed in sumptuous velvets and
          brocades, to the cosiest little single rooms, with a charm all of
          their own. Each bedroom and bathroom is entirely individual:
          one may be furnished with classic simplicity, another with
          generous dashes of eccentricity, yet all are wonderfully
          comfortable. Each of the bedrooms has its own personality,
          as well as its own distinctive furnishings. Some are decorated
          in honour of a previous owner at the Castle; some are themed
          around a period style and others around the architectural features
          of that particular room. The bathrooms are equipped with the
          very best of classic British fitments, designed in traditional style.<br />
          <br />
          Nine of the fifteen bedrooms are on the first floor and these
          tend to have taller ceilings and larger windows, as befits the
          traditions of an authentic historic Castle. Many of the rooms have
          their own ensuite bathroom and some also inter-connect with
          other rooms, which is often convenient for family groups.<br />
          <br />
          Throughout the Castle you will discover imaginative little
          decorative touches – sometimes practical, sometimes thoughtful,
          sometimes whimsical, yet always welcome. Equally appreciated
          are the finest cotton sheets, the thick, fluffy towels and the sense
          of generous hospitality wherever you go.<br />
          <br />
          FRASER WING – a self-contained apartment, with a sitting room,
          four-poster bedroom, little study and ensuite bathroom.<br />
          <br />
          MORRIS – a king or twin-bedded room with Arts and Crafts
          ensuite bathroom.<br />
          <br />
          LORIMER – a four-poster room with distinctive Arts and Crafts
          wood panelling and a large ensuite bathroom.<br />
          <br />
          LOCH – a delightful four-poster room, smaller in scale, with the
          Nymph Bathroom adjacent.<br />
          <br />
          GARDEN ROOM – a traditional double bedroom, connecting with
          the Print Bathroom.<br />
          <br />
          NAPOLEON – a charming single room, connecting with Mackintosh.<br />
          <br />
          MACKINTOSH – a splendid four-poster room, with ensuite
          marble shower room.<br />
          <br />
          LADY GREY – a classic four-poster bedroom, with ensuite
          bathroom; connects with Peacock.<br />
          <br />
          PEACOCK – a single room, connecting with Lady Grey.<br />
          <br />
          There are six further bedrooms on the second floor at the
          Castle – though “second floor” hardly describes
          this fascinating maze of landings, towers, doorways and stone
          staircases. The bedrooms are cosy, imaginative and as generously
          proportioned as those on the first floor.<br />
          <br />
          TWIN CHIMNIES is a king or twin-bedded room, reached by its own
          stone spiral staircase, with ensuite bath and shower.
          The TOWER ROOM is a classic Elizabethan four-poster
          and has adjacent stone stairs leading up to the twin-bedded
          CHINESE ROOM, with ensuite bathroom.<br />
          <br />
          The OLD NURSERY is a king or twin-bedded room, next
          door to the Nursery Kitchen, which offers its own cooking
          and dining facilities and is ideal for families with children.<br />
          <br />
          LADY CAMERON is a spacious and beautifully interiored
          king or twin-bedded room, adjacent to the Turret Bathroom.<br />
          <br />
          Finally, FOUR IN HAND is a double room, unusual in shape,
          featuring a large alcove and the adjacent Wildlife Bathroom.
          
          As if the delights of Lochness Castle itself were not enough,
          the great outdoors offers equally spectacular appeal. Quite
          apart from the history, geography and poetry of Loch Ness, the
          whole region is a paradise for walkers, hikers, golfers, cyclists,
          hunters, fishermen, falconers and nature lovers alike.<br />
          <br />
          We have developed a local network of experts who can guide
          you, coach you, teach you and talk to you about a vast range of
          interests and activities. Whatever your questions or enthusiasms,
          we can provide a specialist to enhance your enjoyment, deepen
          your understanding or just show you how to do it.<br />
          <br />
          Here you can immerse yourself in silence or celebrate with the
          most glamorous birthday party ever. You can be married, or you
          can write a novel in solitary splendour. You can plan commercial
          strategies with business colleagues or launch a new product upon
          an eager audience. Stay at the Castle and five hundred acre
          Estate are yours in their entirety.<br />
          <br />
          Different occasions will require different solutions and
          the staff can be as flexible as your own home. Unlike a
          private club or hotel, there are no rules and regulations (other
          than respect and common sense) and no set times for anything.<br />
          <br />
          Some house parties may prefer to take care of their own catering
          and housekeeping arrangements. However, we always have our
          own team of chefs, housekeepers, managers and facilitators on
          hand, who can be engaged as and when required all year round.
          Whatever your preferred arrangements, we will ensure that you
          experience the very best of Scottish hospitality.<br />
          <br />
          Aldourie Castle has a commercial galley kitchen, with pantry,
          storage and cold rooms, which enable on-site catering at an
          ambitious level and for considerable numbers of guests. In
          addition, there is the Nursery Kitchen on the second floor, ideal
          for catering for younger members of a party. </p>
