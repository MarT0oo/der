        <h1 align="left">Ocean Estate, Pollensa, Mallorca, Spain Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">You can enjoy a stay in one of the major historic olive estates in Pollensa, nestled on the hillside of the Vall de March area just outside Pollensa Old Town. The estate includes an original Moorish tower built in the thirteenth century, was once owned by the wealthy Templars, and has been featured in Traveller Magazine, The Telegraph, The Observer, and many other publications. Sleeps 22. <br>
          <br>
          This impeccably maintained estate has extensive gardens and outdoors areas. The accommodation consists of 6 bedrooms in the main house, 3 bedrooms in the separate villa within the estate and a further 2 bedrooms in a hunting lodge. All three properties enjoy their own outdoor areas, the main house has a swimming pool and the villa has a dipping pool. This beautiful estate offers an incredible Mallorcan experience for large family groups. <br>
          <br>
          MAIN HOUSE <br>
          <br>
          The property was fully reformed and updated in 2006 and is filled with traditional furnishings, Mallorcan textiles, and beamed ceilings. There are many spacious common rooms that easily accommodate a large family or families. The library features a fireplace, satellite TV and DVD player, and a broad selection of games and puzzles. The kitchen also has a TV and there is Wi-Fi throughout. During the high season a cook is also made available for guests. <br>
          <br>
          Central to the flow of the house are its two main courtyards, outfitted with tables and chairs so that you can always find a shaded spot to eat or play a game. In front of the main courtyard is a terrace with a table that seats twelve al fresco with sweeping views of the valley and mountains. This is a perfect setting for a candlelight dinner on a moonlit night. <br>
          <br>
          The large family kitchen is the hub of the house with a full length table of solid olive wood inside and a breakfast table just outside with views over the olive terraces. A large center island is perfect for preparing meals as a group. Or you can have a cook prepare your meals. The estates green garden is just steps away with a full array of in season organic fruits and vegetables as well as chickens that will lay your breakfast eggs. <br>
          <br>
          The circular swimming pool has a pretty sun terrace and shaded lounge area. The house is south facing and has sun throughout the day. There is table tennis, badminton, and a large croquet and boules lawn for family fun. <br>
          <br>
          There are six bedrooms, three with en suite bathrooms. A large playroom (or seventh bedroom, if necessary at an extra cost), ideal for young children, is off the master bedroom and accessible from the main courtyard. There is one further bathroom and cloakroom. Two bedrooms are across a courtyard and next to the kitchen and are perfect for older children or a nanny. <br>
          <br>
          Air conditioning is available in the bedrooms of the main house, as well as the library and the kitchen. There are working fireplaces in the living room, library and kitchen as well as a wood stove in the entrance hall. <br>
          <br>
          SEPARATE VILLA <br>
          <br>
          The villa was completely renovated in 2010 with all new appliances and a fully equipped kitchen. The large family room, which contains the kitchen, dining and living areas is warm and bright with beautiful views out to the mountains. A front patio runs the length of the family room with a thatched roof for a pleasing shade in the summer. There is a large outdoor table and barbecue for al fresco dining. A hammock hangs between two nearby walnut trees. <br>
          <br>
          There are three bedrooms, one conveniently located on the ground floor for guests or for parents. It has its own full bathroom. Upstairs, there are two bedrooms and full bathroom, one a master bedroom that has French doors opening onto a balcony and another bedroom with bunk beds. All rooms are colourfully decorated. There is a large back patio off the upstairs rooms perfect for finding shade in the morning or catching the last of the sun at the end of the day. <br>
          <br>
          Outside there is a dipping pool set on a lower terrace which is perfect after day hiking or at the beach. For spring and autumn renters, there is a wood burning stove in the family room. <br>
          <br>
          RUSTIC HUNTING LODGE <br>
          <br>
          This sanctuary for writers, musicians, artists or for anyone seeking truly to get away from it all is surrounded by birds and with a breathtaking view of the Mediterranean sea, mountains and valley below. <br>
          <br>
          The Great Hall spans thirty by seventy feet. It also has a kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms, a stone patio that runs the length of the hall, and a breakfast patio on the east side off the main bedroom. <br>
          <br>
          Please note there is no air conditioning in the separate 3 bedroom villa. <br>
          <br>
          Surrounded by nature with birds soaring overhead and the tinkle of sheep bells around you, you can hike on the well maintained estate roads and experience life amidst olives and carob groves. <br>
          <br>
          Both houses are surrounded by acres of olive groves and oak and pine forests. There are an amazing array of birds and stunning views for those wishing to hike along the propertys well maintained roads. This is an ideal get-away for nature lovers and for families with young children ready to explore. Because it is above the valley, the estate enjoys temperatures a few degrees cooler in the summer, a nearly ever present light breeze, and no insects. <br>
          <br>
          With hammocks hung throughout its gardens and sheep bells tinkling in the distance, this is a perfect retreat for those wanting a quiet vacation to read, day dream, and experience the best of Mallorcan living. </p>
