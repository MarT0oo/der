        <h1 align="left">Hawkswood Country Estate, Kingdom of Fife, Scotland Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Hawkswood Country Estate is set in the picturesque hamlet of Peat Inn just 10 minutes from St Andrews, the home of golf. Awarded 5 stars and set in 55 acres, Hawkswood Country Estate is surrounded by fantastic views in a peaceful and tranquil setting. <br>
          <br>
          As soon as guests arrive at Hawkswood Country Estate, they know they are somewhere special from the great care and attention to detail by the owners in the design of such lovely properties.  The Estate is made up of three properties – Hawkswood House with 5 ensuite bedrooms taken on a self-catering basis, The Roundel also with 5 ensuite bedrooms and self-catering and Bowhill Bed and Breakfast with 4 ensuite bedrooms which can be booked on an individual basis or to supplement Hawkswood House and The Roundel. We can offer a full Scottish breakfast to guests of Hawkswood House and The Roundel and also help arrange a private chef to cater in our properties creating a wonderful private dining experience. Hawkswood Country Estate also have their own 16-seater mini coach and 8-seater mini bus available to guests requiring transfers within the Fife area and for airport collection. <br>
          <br>
          For keen golfers this is the ultimate golfers paradise with 2 private short game golf areas, a private 270-yard driving range and private hydro spas to relax those muscles. Whilst golf is bound to be the main attraction, Hawkswood Country Estate is also perfect for groups, couples, to share a celebration, private parties, wedding accommodation and for sporting groups. Around 80% of golf is played within 100-yards of the pin. Have you ever hit two great shots to get within 100-yards of the pin and then taken 5 to get down? At Hawkswood House and The Roundel we cater for the golfer. So, in order to improve your short game skills, before visiting one of the great golf courses in nearby St Andrews, we have built your very own Short Game Area in the grounds of each property. The Short Game Area at Hawkswood House was designed and built by a golf professional, to provide the perfect practice area for honing your short game. The course has 5 pitching mats, 6 holes and two bunkers, providing a wide range of lies and distances. This offers the opportunity to practice a variety of shots. The Roundel Short Game Area which opened in May 2017 has 3 pitching mats, 9 holes and two bunkers. Our private 270-yard driving range project is open for all residents to use which again is private and exclusive for guests staying at Hawkswood Country Estate. <br>
          <br>
          Being a family business we are committed to providing an outstanding bespoke service to all of our guests where quality and our impeccable standards are second to none. We thrive to make sure that all of our guests receive a wonderful 5 star experience. <br>
          <br>
          <strong><a href="vacation-Scotland-HawkswoodHouse.htm">Hawkswood House</a></strong>  was our first 5 star exclusive use self catering property to open in the Summer of 2014. The luxury holiday property has 5 bedrooms, to sleep up to 10 guests in exquisite luxury. Hawkswood House has its own private Hydro Spa, all year round private short golf game area, access to a 270-yard driving golf range and Mediterranean barbecue patio area. Hawkswood House combines the charm of the original farm buildings with modern style. Along with the fabulous living areas, we've taken care to create a sense of privacy, so even when sharing the house with a group of friends you'll always have your own relaxing space to enjoy. <br>
          <br>
          Each of the 5 bedrooms has a luxurious ensuite, and in the two glorious reception rooms, log burners create a welcoming focus on chilly days. Large flat screen TVs with full Sky packages in the sitting room and conservatory mean there's never a clash between sports and family viewing. With five ensuite bedrooms, up to 10 guests can enjoy Hawkswood House in absolute privacy and comfort. Four of our five bedrooms are zip and link which can be configured as doubles or twins as required. So, we can accommodate singles groups and couples. <br>
          <br>
          The terraced balcony provides the perfect setting for breakfast or evening drinks in the warmer months, and the conservatory, superb kitchen and spacious dining room provide flexible areas for cooking, dining and entertaining. The kitchen is exceptionally well appointed with an oven, microwave, steam oven and induction hob. There are two tall fridge/freezers, two dishwashers, two sinks and a large dining table. The utility area has a washing machine and dryer. The large boot room offers plenty of space for all your golf kit and outdoor clothing, and after a long day on the course or sightseeing, a session in the whirlpool bath will soothe your muscles. <br>
          <br>

The kernel of this fabulous property, which elevates it and gives it its name, is the magnificent round room. This capacious room, with its high conical roof, is quite stunning and houses a lounge and a dining area. To cap it off its 5 large windows look out to the garden and beyond to the tranquil, beautiful Fife countryside. There is, also, a private Hydro Spa in the garden, outdoor BBQ and patio area. This is housed under a bespoke pagoda, inspired by the shape of The Roundel itself. <br>
