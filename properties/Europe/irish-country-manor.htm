The reception rooms of the Manor House offer a great natural flow suiting multi generation family groups which may have different activity needs at different times. <br>
          <br>
          The nearly 300 year old period entrance to Lisdonagh Manor leads to a curved hallway which features an original early Georgian mural depicting the four virtues of valor, chastity, beauty and justice (currently undergoing restoration). The ground floor has an elegant and spacious drawing room with open fire, separate Georgian dining room, small study or reading room and fully equipped kitchen. Dining can be self-catered or provided by your hosts on request. A sweeping original oak staircase leads to the first floor and 5 en-suite bedrooms with lake or garden views. There are an additional 4 en-suite bedrooms on the lower ground floor as well as the inviting Rafferty's Room which is an atmospheric stone clad snug with mini bar style facilities. Lisdonagh Manor has a long history of connections with famous Irish literary figures and each bedroom has been named after famous Irish writers and artists. <br>
          <br>
          Lisdonagh Manor House and Private Estate offers family friendly accommodation in Galway. The historic Georgian Manor is available for exclusive rental and provides the ultimate destination to holiday in comfort with complete privacy.

          <br>
          Heritage Villas (Lughnasa and Inisfree):<br>
          Lughnasa Villa (Sleeps 4)<br>
          Two story’s with under floor heating on the ground floor as well as a compact galley style kitchen and beautiful antique furnishings. Ideal for friends and families, Lughnasa has two double bedrooms (king size & queen size beds) and two bathrooms. Lughnasa is an ancient Celtic Festival, the first of three harvest festival and said to be created by the Celtic God ‘Lugh’. The month of August is also called Lunasa in Gaelic and it marks the last days of summer. In keeping with the Lisdonagh tradition of naming rooms after Irish literary figures, the naming of the Lughnasa Villa was inspired by Brian Friel’s “Dancing at Lughnasa” play. <br>
          <br>
          Inisfree Villa (Sleeps 4)<br>
          Inisfree is an attractively designed holiday apartment in Galway. On the ground floor there is a large sitting room with plush period furnishings and wood burning stove. A small but fully fitted galley kitchen is adjacent to the sitting room. Upstairs there are two bedrooms, one very spacious double bedroom and a twin bedroom – both en-suite. The villa takes its name from the beautiful poem by Irish poet, William Butler Yeats “The Lake Isle of InisFree”. The poem was written in 1888 and was inspired by an uninhabited island in County Sligo. As Yeats walked through the bustling streets of London, he longed for the peace and tranquility of his homeland. With our 200 acres, private lake and woodland walks, we can assure you that at Lisdonagh you shall have ‘some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow‘. <br>
          <br>
          The Coach House (Sleeps 6)<br>
          Previously the estate’s stables, the two story, 3 bedroom Coach House was beautifully renovated and has both period features and modern comforts. It comprises a large contemporary kitchen and breakfast room, under floor heating, a spacious sitting room complete with stove and TV including both Irish and UK channels as well as a smaller study or games room. Upstairs there are three en-suite double bedrooms. We provide all the bed linen and beds are made up on arrival. We also provide towels. Bed configurations do have some flexibility and all requests must be confirmed in advance of your arrival. <br>
          <br>

Please note that our Georgian Manor House is only accessible to guests that have hired Lisdonagh Manor on an exclusive basis. <br>
          <br>
