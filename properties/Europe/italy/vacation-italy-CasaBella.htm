        <h1 align="left">Casa Bella, Vicenza, Italy Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">The Veneto Dreams is an incredible property walking distance to lovely shops and dining.  This incredibly elegant mansion has been blessed by many distinguished guests throughout the course of time and painters such as Gianbattista and Giandomenico Tiepolo whose masterpiece frescoes adorn the Villa Valmarana  Nani nearby also drew inspiration from the beauty of the area. With its wide panoramic terrace facing the golden sunsets amidst ancient cypresses, cedars, pines and the most scented roses, geraniums and lilies, this estate is one of the finest examples of classic noble villas in Veneto. The swimming pool next to the house overlooks the Villa Valmarana and one is constantly reminded, even during the most informal leisure activities of the history, art and culture of the surrounding area. <br>
          <br>
          There is a changing room with fridge, shower and plenty of lounge chairs for soaking the summer sunshine. The gate to the property is remotely activated and security cameras abound within the garden
          and the perimeter of the villa, which makes this property particularly fit for guests in search of privacy and high security. Air conditioning is present in the main bedrooms, the first floor guest room corridor, and the main living areas while ventilation is provided for guest’s comfort during summer months. On the lower ground floor there’s a country style kitchen with a large electric oven and five gas hobs, together with a microwave, a large fridge, freezer, fireplace, dishwasher, washing machine, and a lift to send all those gourmet creations to the dining room on the ground floor. The property also features a utility room with ironing facilities, a drying room and the staff accommodation. The main reception room and the dining room, sumptuously furnished and tastefully decorated in a traditional yet functional way, are located on the ground floor, together with the main bedroom suite composed by a master bedroom with sitting room, changing room and a fully equipped bathroom - this room has direct access to
          the garden and the swimming pool. An extra double bedroom with bathroom en-suite is located on the ground floor. <br>
          <br>
          The sitting room has direct access to the terrace area, sheltered from the sun by an electric awning, and warmed during the winter months by a wonderful fireplace. The dining room has a bow-window annex with extra seating and a television, and great views of the garden and valley beyond. Four additional bedrooms, twins or doubles, two of which en-suite, a sitting room and a family bathroom with a separate shower room are located on the first floor Twin beds can be made into doubles if needed. The last bedroom, a charming double bedroom with en-suite bathroom and air conditioning, is finally located on the top floor. The property features a changing room with fridge, shower and plenty of lounge chairs for soaking the summer sunshine. <br>

          Area Information <br>
          <br>
          VENETO <br>
          <br>
          Situated in Italy's northeast, Veneto extends from the Dolomites to the Adriatic Sea, by way of an expansive range of hills and a valley furrowed by rivers, canals and the Po River Delta The typical scenery of Veneto's coast is the Venetian lagoon, and, right on this very lagoon stands perhaps the most unique city in the entire world - Venice, visited by millions of travellers every year. Yet all of the Veneto, a region with a thousand different faces, is the custodian of natural, artistic, and traditional treasures. Veneto expresses an extraordinary variety in its scenery: from the Dolomites, dipped in the crimson shades of the sunset, to the eastern shore of Lake Garda and Peschiera del Garda, Torri del Benaco and other tourist destinations. Long, sandy beaches alternate with well-known resorts such as Lido di Venezia Jesolo, Bibione, Cavallino and Caorle. In this spectacular natural setting lies a rich cultural heritage that renders the Veneto such a fascinating region, from its cities of art to the magnificent Palladian villas scattered
          along the Brenta Riviera. And not to be forgotten are the small villages of Arquà Petrarca, Monselice, Padua, Asolo, and Bassano del Grappa and Verona that bring together the most typical aspects of this diverse and varied region. Veneto is also an ideal destination for a vacation of comfort and relaxation, thanks to its possession of thermal waters with their valuable therapeutic properties: the gentle slopes of the Euganean Hills are home to the well-equipped facilities of the Euganean Spas: e.g.  Abano, Montegrotto and Teolo, where guests can combine treatments and therapies with pleasant excursions out into the surrounding areas. <br>
          <br>
          VICENZA <br>
          <br>
          Vicenza represents a unique artistic achievement in the many architectural contributions from Andrea Palladio integrated within its historic fabric and creating its overall character. Through its architecture, the city has exerted exceptional influence on architectural and urban design in most European countries and throughout the world. Vicenza is situated at the foothills of the Berici Hills and is a beautiful city of art,
          known as the 'City of Palladio'. The centre is easily reached on foot from the property in about 20 minutes. During your stay at the villa you may also want to explore the nearby towns such as Padova, Verona and Venice that are reachable by a short time trip by car or by train. In particular we recommend Padova with the most spectacular Cappella degli Scrovegni and the Giotto frescoes (20 minutes drive and same by train), Verona with the Arena and Giulietta's home and much more at 40 minutes drive 30 minutes by train and, of course, Venezia, with Piazza San Marco, La Salute and more at 1 hour drive and same by train. <br>
          <br>
          We can arrange tours and lots of great and fun things to do, with our wonderful tour guides you will take you through and show you the sights and sounds of  Vento. <br>
          <br>
          Policies <br>
