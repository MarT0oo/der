          <br>
          Whether you need to hold an executive meeting, a conference or a full-scale team training day, Blairquhan Castle can offer you an inspiring setting that is free from distractions and interruptions. Make use of one (or more) of our four fabulous function rooms for your corporate event during the day and, once business has been taken care of, enjoy a private dining experience like no other in the evening. <br>
          <br>
          There’s no need for lengthy journeys to and from the venue either, as Blairquhan can accommodate up to 30 people within the castle itself. Should you need to shelter more than 30 clients and/or colleagues we also have eight cottages within the estate for them to rest up in, ensuring that they are fresh and ready for the day ahead. <br>
          <br>
          Our staff will take care of everything for you, enabling you to concentrate on what you do best. With their expert help you will be able to stay focused on the task at hand without worrying about anything other than the points you wish to get across to your clients and/or colleagues. <br>
          <br>
          Hosting a memorable party for your special guests is no easy task, and finding a sophisticated and exclusive venue is generally the hardest detail of all to get right. Thankfully, with more than 200 years of Scottish baronial history behind it, Blairquhan Castle offers you the unique opportunity to host a truly unforgettable experience for those lucky enough to receive an invite. <br>
          <br>
          Your guests will enter via the main entrance where they will instantly fall in love with the exquisite interior of the saloon, complete with numerous portraits adorning the walls. Discovering the rest of the castle and its stunning gardens - glass of Champagne in hand - will further add to their experience, and there is so much to see. From the avenue of 18th century lime trees through to the intimate library - the whole property is steeped in history, with talking points aplenty. <br>
          <br>
          Knowing that they are part of an exclusive set will encourage your guests to be at ease, allowing them to freely mingle and enjoy the company of others. After all, what good is a party without a little social interaction? <br>
          <br>
          Scotland is famous throughout the world as the home of golf, and the game is etched into the hearts of many a Scot. The county of Ayrshire, where Blairquhan Castle is situated, is equally enamoured with the sport. The Open Championship was born here way back in 1860 and the first ever recorded hole-in-one was made on the same course, Prestwick, by ‘Young’ Tom Morris in 1868. <br>
          <br>
          As well as the historic Prestwick Golf Club, Ayrshire also boasts an abundance of other courses for you to enjoy; two of which you may have heard of before, namely the more recent Open venues - Turnberry and Royal Troon. Both of these famous courses are a mere 35 minute drive away from the castle gates, making Blairquhan the perfect place to stay if you are planning a golf trip to this stunning part of the world. <br>
          <br>
          By opting to hire the castle for your own exclusive use you’ll be able to enjoy all that the property and its grounds has to offer, without the worry of any unwelcomed interruptions. It will just be you and your select group of friends or colleagues, with fine food, luxurious surroundings…..and the inevitable tales from the course! <br>
          <br>
          Blairquhan has recently joined Ayrshire Golf Scotland as a platinum member. The collaboration aims to further develop golf tourism in Ayrshire & Arran <br>
          <br>
          Fancy doing something a little different from the norm this Christmas? What better place is there to hold a celebration of the festive season than in your very own castle? We can’t think of one either - which is why we are giving you the opportunity to have exclusive use of Blairquhan Castle this Christmas. Whether you are planning a full scale shindig or a quiet, private dining experience for close family and friends, we can accommodate your every wish. <br>
          <br>
          So, if you would like to celebrate Christmas in style this year, why not join us here at Blairquhan for lunch or dinner. Bookings can still be made for parties of 20 or more and, should you wish to stay the night, our beautiful bedrooms are also available too. <br>
          <br>
          Whether you have just had your wedding day, finished an exhausting round of business meetings or played a 36-hole golfing marathon at Turnberry and Royal Troon, you’re going to need somewhere to rest and recuperate. Our accommodation fits the bill nicely, and you’ll soon be soothed by the grand setting and the ever-welcoming, friendly staff here at Blairquhan. <br>
          <br>
          You may decide to stay in the castle itself or choose to make use of one of the beautiful cottages that are available. Either way, you’re guaranteed to find everything to your satisfaction. Once fully rested you can explore the grounds of the estate and maybe even partake in a little fly-fishing on Blairquhan’s own small stretch of the River Girvan should you so desire. <br>
          <br>
          The former European City of Culture, Glasgow, is only an hour away if you want to give your visit an urban edge. Widely regarded as one of the UK’s finest shopping cities, Glasgow also has a wealth of intellectual attractions including an assortment of museums, art galleries and concert halls. <br>
          <br>
          Whatever you decide to do with your time here, being with us will make your stay. <br>
          <br>
          Our chef at Blairquhan Castle has developed a range of menus, using the best locally sourced Scottish produce. <br>
          <br>
          Our mission at Blairquhan is to showcase Scotland’s best hospitality, and its scrumptious local food to our guests from all over the world. <br>
          <br>
          When it comes to holding meetings, Blairquhan Castle is the business. Our friendly and experienced staff have been welcoming corporate guests for many years and they will be on hand to deliver an unrivalled service to you, your colleagues and your clients. <br>
          <br>
          You’ll have four first-class function rooms to choose from - each with their own unique character and style - which can be laid out specifically to best suit your needs. The layouts available, with capacities, are as follows: <br>
          <br>
          That being said, our head chef still takes great pride in sourcing only the very finest ingredients from local producers. He does this in order to create dishes so mouth-watering, you’ll be making involuntary murmurs of pleasure with every bite. And, when you couple this with our phenomenal range of very special wines, you have a dining experience to rival any other. <br>
          <br>
          Our dining rooms are places where you’ll want to take your time and not be rushed. Decorated immaculately, and adorned with fine art and period furniture, they exude a sense of sophistication that cannot be replicated. With this in mind, our unobtrusive staff will let you and your guests savour your surroundings as they effortlessly cater to your every whim. <br>
          <br>
          Whether you are entertaining business clients, celebrating a special occasion with family and friends or if you just fancy doing something a little different for no particular reason at all, Blairquhan Castle offers you and your guests a private dining experience that will create wonderful memories for many years to come. <br>
          <br>
          Make no mistake, having your own room in a castle as beautiful and historic as Blairquhan is an impressive statement to make, but we like to do things a little differently here. Despite the obvious grandeur of the estate we aim to keep things understated and simple, rather than opulent and extravagant; classy, not flashy. <br>
          <br>
          This is portrayed best by the 15 bedrooms within the castle. Each one has been individually designed in a sumptuous, yet elegant fashion that will make you feel right at home from the moment you arrive. You have the choice between one of the five grand rooms which have original two or four-poster beds to welcome you, or the ten other deluxe bedrooms that make up our accommodation here at Blairquhan Castle. Whichever you choose, you will not be disappointed. <br>
          <br>
          Every one of the bedrooms has tall sash windows that open up to stunning views of the surrounding grounds and the Ayrshire countryside beyond. Beautifully spacious, each room has either a super king or king size bed for you to fall into at the end of long day. Be warned though, our bed linen is so luxurious that you may struggle to get up at all the following morning! <br>
          <br>
          The rest of the interior is equally impressive, with period furniture sitting side-by-side with modern bathrooms that have been installed with great attention to detail. Thick, fluffy towels are waiting to swaddle you after you have pampered yourself with the L'Occitane toiletries that are found in every bathroom. <br>
          <br>
          Complimentary Wi-Fi is available throughout the castle should you wish to not be completely shut off from the outside world. There are, however, tea and coffee making facilities in every room should you decide that the world can wait just a little while longer. <br>
          <br>
          Situated inside the Blairquhan estate are eight self-catering cottages which are available for bookings all year round. Each with their own individual name, these cottages are the perfect place to spend a few days winding down from the rigours of the modern world. Tranquil and secluded, they offer you the opportunity to get away from it all, allowing you the indulgence of being surrounded by the beautiful Ayrshire countryside. <br>
          <br>
          Each cottage comes complete with wonderfully luxurious towels and bed linen. Oil-fired central heating will keep you warm and cosy regardless of what the weather may be doing outside and your electricity usage is included in the booking price too. All cottages come with the necessary amenities that you would expect from a self-catering accommodation, so you can step straight in and make yourself at home. <br>
          <br>
          Once you are settled in you are free to explore the fabulous grounds here at Blairquhan. Many miles of woodland walks are yours to discover, as well as a beautiful stretch of the River Girvan just north of the castle. We even have a Giant Redwood tree on the estate that is believed to have been grown from a seed which was brought to Scotland from America by the SS Great Britain in the 19th century! <br>
          <br>
          Beautifully integrated into the 200 acres of parkland that make up the estate, the unique gardens here at Blairquhan Castle are something to behold. They were originally laid out back in 1816 and much of the landscaping still remains to this day, most notably the unique walled garden. <br>
          <br>
          The rising ground to the south allowed the landscapers to create an unusual three-walled perimeter. During its construction the main wall was built with flues installed so that it could be heated to protect the precious fruit trees during the colder Scottish months. <br>
          <br>
          With well-established woodlands, beautifully manicured lawns, an avenue of 18th century lime trees and many other magnificent vistas, your photographer will be spoilt for choice when it comes to capturing your first married moments together here in the gardens of Blairquhan. <br />
