        <h1 align="left">Mont Rochelle, Western Cape, South Africa Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Welcome to Mont Rochelle in the Western Cape. This truly is one of the most beautiful parts of South Africa, a country I’ve been a regular visitor to for many years. During your time with us I hope you get the opportunity to try some of the fantastic wines produced in the region and experience some of the local hospitality - I always make a point of doing so! <br>
          <br>
          Mont Rochelle is a stunning 26-bedroom hotel and vineyard just under an hour’s drive from Cape Town in the town of Franschhoek in South Africa. Franschhoek is a traditional vineyard town in the Western Cape Province famously known as the French Corner of the Cape and is considered to be the food and wine capital of South Africa.<br>
          <br>
          The grounds at Mont Rochelle cover 39 hectares (about 100 acres) and you’re welcome to go exploring. A favourite activity for many of our guests is picnicking on the estate – our kitchen can arrange a well-stocked picnic basket with a chilled bottle of wine (or two!). There are two restaurants, a cosy bar, a spa, a gym and a heated outdoor pool. That’s not forgetting a 37 hectare vineyard and wine cellar of course!<br>
          <br>
          Title deeds to the estate were first granted to the de Villiers family in 1688 and building commenced in 1700. The cairn of stones on the property marks the position of a beacon which was lit to advise local residents that the local preacher had arrived so they could all gather for prayer. It was also used to welcome VIPs to the district. Apart from the fact that wine has been consistently produced on the land since that time, not much is known about the ownership until the early part of the 20th century when the Roux family held title to the estate.<br>
          <br>
          In 1940 Abraham Michelson purchased the land which at the time consisted of a cellar with 20 large oak vats with the majority of vines having been planted around the time of the last Boer War (1899- 1902). Descendants of the Michelson family still live in the area and own part of the land from that original holding. Michelson started Franschhoek Winery after the 2nd World War and the farmers in the district used to send their bulk wine to them for bottling. During this period Italian prisoners-of-war were used to work in the district’s vineyards and at the war’s end Mr Michelson employed one of them, a Mr AG Augustini, to manage their winery. In 1955 Abraham died and his three children inherited the farm. One son ran the farm while a daughter moved away to France, and Siggy Michelson moved with his wife and four children into a small residence where our present reception area stands.<br>
          <br>
          Over the past 20 years the building has been extended on numerous occasions and has also changed hands several times. The most recent owner prior to Sir Richard Branson was Erwin Schnitzler, a German hotelier and Miko Rwayitare, who took possession of the hotel and winery which at the time was called ‘La Couronne’.<br>
          <br>
          La Couronne Hotel and Restaurant was severely damaged by a fire in February 2006. After a period of repair and renovation, Messieurs Rwayitare and Schnitzler used the opportunity to merge the hotel and the neighbouring Mont Rochelle Mountain Vineyards to create ‘Mont Rochelle Hotel and Mountain Vineyards’. Mr Rwayitare was the first black owner of a vineyard in South Africa and the vineyard’s premium wine was named after him – as well as the current main restaurant.<br>
          <br>
          Mont Rochelle was purchased by Sir Richard Branson in 2014 and now joins the exclusive Virgin Limited Edition collection which includes Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands, The Roof Gardens in London and Ulusaba Private Game Reserve in South Africa. After an extensive period of refurbishment the hotel began welcoming guests in September 2014. <br>
          <br>
          The area around Franschhoek, which in the Afrikaans language means ‘French corner ’, was as the name suggests once a French enclave when over 300 years ago a group of Huguenot settlers arrived fleeing religious persecution. That influence, which nestled right alongside the larger Dutch-speaking community, is what gives the region such a rich and varied history, and unsurprisingly, a taste for fine food and wine! <br>
          <br>
          Country Kitchen is opened for lunch and a short drive from the main hotel. Our casual dining restaurant is an ideal spot to take in the sunshine and views from our terrace while sampling the delights of our kitchen. <br>
          <br>
          Miko is the ideal setting for some fantastic gourmet meals including those for special occasions. We aim to showcase the very best produce and seasonal ingredients from South Africa paired with some excellent wine. <br>
          <br>
          Located a short walk from the main hotel, the Manor House is the latest addition to Mont Rochelle. With private facilities including two pools and gym, four suites plus a cosy bunkroom, the Manor House is available for exclusive use all year-round. <br>
          <br>
          Franschhoek is the food and wine capital of South Africa so any stay would be incomplete without a visit to the wine cellar. Over 110 tons of grapes can be processed here in one season so make sure to arrange a tour during your trip. <br>
          <br>
          If you're visiting South Africa with children there are some additional paperwork requirements to take into consideration, regardless of whether the children are travelling with their parent(s) or guardian(s). The requirements apply regardless of nationality, and in order to be allowed to board at your point of departure, customers must bring the necessary paperwork when travelling <br>
          <br>
          Sustainability<br>
          <br>
          We know just how important it is to take care of the environment, and we are extremely sensitive to the impact our properties may have on the local communities within which we operate. We believe in environmentally sustainable tourism and remain committed to making a difference wherever we can. <br>
          <br>
          What does this mean in practice? <br>
          <br>
          Our approach includes a commitment to responsible supply chain management, fair trade policies, ethical dealings with our employees as well as the local community, and of course the environment. We know that some changes can be made immediately however others may take a little more time. Virgin Limited Edition is proud to have taken steps at all our properties to reduce any negative environmental impact, and Mont Rochelle is no exception. <br>
          <br>
          Mont Rochelle is very conscious about ensuring that our supply chains are ethical in regards to the raw materials and labour used. We strive to ensure that as much of our food as possible is locally sourced in South Africa to ensure maximum economic benefit to the people and minimal transport and ‘food miles’. <br>
          <br>
          Ditching the plastic <br>
          <br>
          Some of the properties in our collection are in parts of the world where the local water supply doesn’t always inspire confidence, so we previously made bottled water available to our guests. As the result was a lot of discarded plastic bottles we worked with a supplier to source branded glass water bottles which are washable and can be reused again and again. A filter machine sits on site and the team is trained in how to operate it hygienically. The result is a complete elimination of plastic bottles used on the Mont Rochelle estate with similar results elsewhere. <br>
          <br>
          Things to do<br>
          <br>
          From personalised wine tasting to a picnic amongst the vineyards, wine enthusiasts will be in heaven at Mont Rochelle! If you're looking to get a bit more active we recommend a dip in the outdoor heated swimming pool. You could also work up an appetite in the gym or just sit back, relax and indulge yourself in our in-house spa. <br>
          <br>
          Swimming Pool and Hammam<br>
          <br>
          Take a dip and relax in the main outdoor heated swimming pool at Mont Rochelle - there are some fantastic views of the Franschhoek Mountains. Bar service is available around the pool and fresh pool towels are available. Resident guests are welcome to make use of Hammam at their leisure as long as it’s not in use for a scheduled treatment. <br>
          <br>
          Spa Treatments<br>
          <br>
          What could be more relaxing than a spa treatment during your stay? Mont Rochelle has two dedicated spa treatment rooms as well as a Hammam. We use the eco-friendly Africology ‘Authentic’ range of products which are made from 100% essential oils and natural plant extracts. <br>
          <br>
          Biking <br>
          <br>
          There are some wonderful routes that make it easy to explore the surrounding area on bike . We can arrange rentals with a local company, just let us know and we can book these for you. <br>
          <br>
          Hiking<br>
          <br>
          Enjoy a hike through hills, valleys and vineyards surrounding the hotel, as well as in local reserves. The Mont Rochelle Reserve on the opposite side of the valley offers superb views of the wine valley and on a clear day you can even see Table Mountain and the ocean! The walks vary in length from 3 to 8 hours and are of moderate intensity. Required permits and maps are available from the Tourism Office in the centre of town. You are welcome to take walks through our farm and our only request is that you stay on the walkways, thus preserving the fragile vines that produce our splendid wines. <br>
          <br>
          Tennis Courts<br>
          <br>
          We have a Astroturf floodlit tennis court and a cabana complete with a kitchen and bathroom. Racquets and balls supplied. <br>
          <br>
          Retail Therapy <br>
          <br>
          Franschhoek village offers a variety of art and craft shops as well as galleries and antique stores and we can point you in the right direction. <br>
          <br>
          Golf <br>
          <br>
          South Africa is known for the high standard of its many golf courses with courses in Paarl, Stellenbosch and Somerset West. The hotel can arrange tee-off times for you. Booking is vital during the summer season in order to avoid disappointment. <br>
          <br>
          Gym<br>
          <br>
          For the active types our gym is available between 06h00 and 22h00 every day. There are two treadmills, bikes, an adjustable bench and suspension training pack and a set of free-weights. </p>
