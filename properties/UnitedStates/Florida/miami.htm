          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Everyone loves the Idea of Visiting Miami Beach.&nbsp; This  city has recently undergone some major changes, including a Live Theater that  can be seen along Miami&rsquo;s New Downtown Center area.&nbsp; Miami has undergone  such a transformation that many are dubbing it the New City of Miami.&nbsp; The  areas that our Vacation Rentals are in are quite different.&nbsp; Miami, unlike  other cities, spans many smaller sub-sections, such as: Coral Gables, Sunny  Isles, Normandy Isles, Aventura, North Miami, North Miami Beach, Miami Beach,  Pinecrest, Palmetto bay, Old Cutler Bay, and many more.&nbsp; Some people  describe it as a melting pot and it can be described in many ways, but  certainly never boring.<br>
            <br>
            The place most people are familiar is Miami Beach.&nbsp; In  recent years Miami Beach has seen a host of High Profile Celebrities buying up  property in very exclusive neighborhoods.&nbsp; These celebrities are a great  draw to our beaches, but they are not the only reason people come.&nbsp; You  can walk down Ocean Drive and find a host of &ldquo;one of a kind&rdquo; designer stores,  that you will find nowhere else in the world.&nbsp; Models come here to get  their start as do designers, all hoping to catch the crowds that are often drawn  to these locations.&nbsp; In addition to shopping, you have a host of  restaurants and caf&eacute;&rsquo;s lining the streets.&nbsp; You will never be at a loss of  where to go, it&rsquo;s just impossible to try them all. <br>
            <br>
            And of course, Miami is  known for it&rsquo;s beaches, they are truly a draw for people from all over the  world.&nbsp; The draw may also be the beautiful people who often visit the  beach, making it a hot-spot for singles looking to enjoy the sunshine and some  night life.&nbsp; No matter what the draw, Miami Beach is a great place to visit.&nbsp;  We must give it an Adult Rating due to the area and destination  specifications.&nbsp; It is great for Adults, we do not recommend it for small  children.<br>
            <br>
            You can now rent a home in allot of different areas of  Miami.&nbsp; The newest places are Eastern Shores and Normandy Isle.&nbsp;  Eastern Shores is a great place for those looking for a residential community,  away from all the crowds, this is a plus for those with small children.&nbsp;  The area is often a draw to families traveling with groups of children, looking  for the beaches, the pool, and gorgeous views.&nbsp; There is so much you can  do in Miami, from the <strong><em>Metro Zoo</em></strong> with your family, where you can  find incredible shows, rides, and children&rsquo;s activities.&nbsp; There is also  the <strong><em>Monkey Jungle</em></strong>, a great draw for nature lovers, this fun and  fantastic place let&rsquo;s you feed the animals while you walk through the park,  where else can you do that?&nbsp; If you enjoy the sea, you have to try <strong><em>Miami  Seaquarium</em></strong>, where the fun is never ending.&nbsp; They host water shows  where they interact with the public, they also have animal shows, and if you  register you can swim with the dolphins, it&rsquo;s truly an amazing treat.&nbsp; To  round off the things for families to do we highly recommend the <strong><em>Fairchild  Tropical Gardens</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Children&rsquo;s Museum</em></strong>, and the <strong><em>Parrot  Jungle</em></strong>. All of these are great places for you and your children to  visit while in town.<br>
            <br>
            Don&rsquo;t forget that we also have pet friendly homes. </p>
