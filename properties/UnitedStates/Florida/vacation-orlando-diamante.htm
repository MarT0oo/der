          <h1>Diamante, Kissimmee, Orlando, Florida Vacation Rental</h1>
          <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
          <p>Welcome to the Diamante, a home built and furnished for the  traveller who demands the highest standards. This elegantly furnished home has  six bedrooms, five and one-half bathrooms and numerous amenities including a private  pool and spa. The four master suites with king size beds and private bathrooms  allow several couples to have their privacy.<br><br>As you enter the home, you are presented with a beautiful  conversational burgundy sofa and a square cocktail table in the cozy living  room. A few more steps and you are at the beautiful dining room with its double  pedestal table and six Marietta Black Pepper upholstered chairs. The foyer  table with marble top provides just the right piece for the hallway going into  the kitchen and family room.<br><br>As you enter the family room, you are overcome by the  vaulted ceiling with its eighteen foot long ceiling to floor drapes custom made  with beautiful butterfly fabric. The eight foot wide glass doors out to the  pool deck are available from the family room, the kitchen eating area and the  master bedroom. The cocktail table provides a place for drinks and all those  miscellaneous things you accumulate. Two full size couches, covered with the  comfortable microfiber cocoa fabric facing the large screen TV, invite you to  relax on their reclining end seats. The fully stocked kitchen with an abundance  of small appliances has everything you need to cook a many course dinner. These  amenities provide you with the option of skipping the fuss and expense of going  to restaurants while you relax and enjoy the pool and house.<br><br>You may want to go out the door to the lanai and spend some  time soaking up the Florida sun. The covered ten foot pool deck has two ceiling  speakers so you can enjoy music from the stereo on the family room  entertainment center without disrupting those inside. You could step into the  fifteen by thirty foot crystal clear water of the heated pool or really relax  in the one hundred degree Jacuzzi or you can just lay back on one of our comfortable  loungers. The pool and lanai are south facing which gives you sun all day long.  Of course you can stay under the covered deck if you already had enough sun.  The pool has an easily removable safety fence providing extra protection for  young children.<br><br>Sleeping accommodations are exceptional. The wood panel  king-size bed in the first floor bedroom is breathtaking as it faces the  paneled armoire with TV behind its beautiful paneled doors. Immediate access to  the pool and spa is available using the glass doors on the back wall. On the  other side of the bed is the bathroom with double sinks, an over-sized bath tub  and a separate shower stall. There are three bedrooms on the second floor with  king-size beds. The first has the spectacular leather headboard bed with high  quality bedding that makes sleeping a true pleasure. This bedroom also has a  private bathroom, a TV, a ceiling fan and a clock radio. In addition, this room  also has a full-size crib with beautiful Winnie the Pooh bedding.<br><br>The next bedroom has an iron king-size bed with high quality  bedding, a private bathroom, a TV, a ceiling fan and a clock radio. The third  bedroom on the second floor with a king-size bed also has the exquisite iron  bed with the high quality bedding, a private bathroom, a TV, a ceiling fan and  a clock radio. The children will want to spend a lot of time in the Cinderella  and the Buzz Light-year bedrooms that share the SpongeBob bathroom. The four  low post panel beds offer maximum comfort for busy children while providing them  with an environment they love. The beds are big enough to accommodate two  children up to the age of about ten making it very comfortable and cozy.<br><br>And for the person who must do some work, the loft has a  beautiful desk and hutch combination with an extremely comfortable chair where  any desk work can be done with the computer provided. Or you can use your  laptop with the wireless Internet access.<br><br>For those families with small children, we provide the  beautiful crib in the upstairs bedroom as well as a high-chair, a stroller, a  dressing table and a bassinet. For your convenience, we also provide a clothes  washer and dryer in the utility room. <br><br>When you approach the Emerald Island Resort, you see the  beautiful entrance followed by the dramatic palm tree lined entrance with the  beautiful foliage leading up to the security gates. Following that, you see the  dolphin fountain and the very popular Clubhouse. The exquisite Emerald Island  Resort Clubhouse of four thousand square feet has a heated pool and spa, a  fitness room, a Sauna, a Tiki Bar, a gathering room, computers with internet  access and a Video game room. On the side of the clubhouse are a playground and  a volleyball court. Tennis courts and a basketball court are nearby on the  Emerald Island Resort property.<br><br>All of these amenities are available for your use as a  renter. All of this is located in the exclusive gated resort of Emerald Island  which is only three miles from Disney World. Two stop signs and two traffic  lights is all that separates you from the Disney property.<br><br>The owners of this splendid home took every opportunity to  give you and your guests the ultimate vacation luxury in your temporary home  away from home. Vacation homes are very spacious and comfortable. They are more  affordable than using hotel rooms. If you need two or more hotel rooms, the  costs of the sleeping accommodations in a vacation home are much less than  hotels. You can cook in a vacation home having your favorite foods while  reducing your vacation costs by eating in.<br><br>A vacation home kitchen never closes and there's always a  table free to use. A vacation home also provides more privacy and security  especially for young children. The vacation home is so comfortable you can  actually replace a day at the parks with a pool day using your private pool and  save a few hundred dollars. Many guests leave our home and tell us they will  never go back to hotel rooms.</p>
