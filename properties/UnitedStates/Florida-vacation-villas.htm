          <p><strong>Florida Vacation Villa Rentals are some of the most sought  after destinations.</strong><br>
            <br>
            Florida has long been the destination of choice for  those jetsetters traveling in from Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago.&nbsp;  Now you can find people from all over the world coming to visit the Sunshine  State for some of the greatest beaches, hot spots, and family fun activities  all packed in one.&nbsp; The Gulf Coast of Florida is quite enjoyed by those  from Germany, Norway, and many European families.&nbsp; The draw is the  weather, the climate, the boating, and the beautiful villa choices.&nbsp;  Welcome to Florida, Willkommen to Florida, Bienvenue à la Floride, Velkommen  til Florida, Bem-vindo à Flórida. <br>
            Where else can you find a tropical climate all year  round that is close enough for American’s to enjoy without a passport?&nbsp; Many  Americans love to travel, it’s part of our culture. We take our vacations with  family, friends, and often times we bring along our extended family.&nbsp; It’s  not until recently that Americans were drawn back to inter country  travel.&nbsp; Because of the high cost of travel overseas and the incontinences  that can come from passports, checkpoints, and traveling with small children,  the lure is obvious.&nbsp; So it’s no wonder that Americans are coming to  Florida, where Disney World, Sea World, Magic Kingdom, Busch Gardens, Parrot  Jungle, Monkey Jungle, and so many more wonderful children’s parks are  available to families.&nbsp; We are a Global Mecca of fun, a true travelers  paradise. <br>
            Florida is best known for Miami Beach, with its high  energy nightlife and boutique shopping.&nbsp; Miami Beach also has one of the  best beaches around, where you can find sand for miles and miles.&nbsp; Miami  Beach also offers some great Star Sightings, from Star Island to the Venetian  islands, if you sit around long enough you are bound to&nbsp; run into or see  your share of the rich and famous.&nbsp; Miami Beach Villa rentals are  prohibited for less than 6 months, but go just a few miles away to Venetian  Islands or to North Miami and South Miami and you will find great Vacation  Villas.&nbsp; You are really just a 15-20 minute Drive away. <br>
            In Florida you will not see it all till you’ve visited  Fort Lauderdale, known as being the Riviera of Florida.&nbsp; Fort Lauderdale  is not what it was 30 years ago, it has grown and expanded to host annual  fashion and film premieres.&nbsp; Fort Lauderdale’s famed Las Olas Boulevard  also offers some of the most exclusive Vacation Villas you will ever  find.&nbsp; The word Posh is just not enough to describe this location.&nbsp;  Enjoy the boardwalks, high end shopping at Galleria Mall, and the extraordinary  beaches. <br>
            Now For those who enjoy a quiet and more resort style  community, you can try Boca Raton’s Great vacation Villas, or West Palm Beach  and it’s very exclusive high end rentals.&nbsp; These are all great choices.</p>
          <br>
          The&nbsp; other notable areas to visit are Cape Coral,  Fort Myers, and Naples, for the best vacations around.&nbsp; It’s just another  great part of Florida.&nbsp; If visiting Cape Coral and the NE part of Florida  remember they are boating communities and you can always book a yacht with your  home.&nbsp; The Keys are also a great place to visit, recommended for those  seeking to get away from it all.&nbsp; The Florida Keys stretch over 100  islands and include some of the best fishing, sailing, swimming, and some  pretty amazing oceanfront residences.&nbsp; The ideas are just endless! <br>
