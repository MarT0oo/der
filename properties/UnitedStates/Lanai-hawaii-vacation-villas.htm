            <p>Lana'i. If you've ever watched the sunset from the West Coast of the Hawaiian island of Maui, chances are you've seen the island of Lana'i in the distance, beckoning like Bali Hai, the clouds caught on its central peak breaking the day's last rays into stunning shafts of golden light. Now you can visit and relax in this seemingly unreachable paradise with friends and family.<br />
              <br />
              Slow down and connect with Hawaii's "Spirit of Aloha" on sleepy Lana’i. If you’re an outdoors enthusiast or just looking to have a peaceful getaway, there are many gorgeous sites to see and activities to choose from on the island. Lana'i has shopping and dining in Lana'i City, golfing at highly-acclaimed golf courses, exquisite beaches and much more! Also, there are far fewer visitors, which gives the island a distinctly exclusive feel. <br />
              <br />
              Hulopoe Bay is famous for its pristine waters, which are perfect for snorkeling. Explore the tide pools, swimming or simply getting a golden Hawaiian sun-kissed tan on the beach. Scuba diving the Lanai Cathedrals will be an unforgettable underwater adventure or you can admire the waters from land at Puu Pehe, also referred to by locals as "Sweetheart Rock," where you’re guaranteed a show of a lifetime during Hawaii’s Humpback Whale season! <br />
              <br />
              For the golfing aficionado, Lana'i is home to two famous golf courses, which are sure to challenge and please. The Four Seasons Resort Lanai at Manele Bay offers Manele Golf Course, a challenging 18-hole golf course overlooking Hulopoe Bay that was designed by "The Golden Bear" himself, Jack Nicklaus. Also, the Koele Golf Course is highly regarded and located at Four Seasons Resort Lanai. <br />
              <br />
              If you know and love Hawaii, and are looking for a new experience, come and explore relaxing Lana'i, a charming Hawaiian island that is waiting to be discovered! </p>
