        <h1 align="left">Waterfalls Estates, Maui, Hawaii Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Welcome to Waterfalls Estates Maui, a 6 bedroom 9 bath 11,000 square foot panoramic ocean view single-family vacation estate and spa, spread over 2 acres and nestled in a quiet residential community overlooking the sunny leeward Makena-Kihei-Wailea coastline of Maui island. Maui island was voted #1 best island in the WORLD by TripAdvisor’s 2016 Travelers’ Choice Awards! Maui island was also voted #1 best island in the U.S. by Conde Nast Traveler’s Readers’ Choice Awards published on October 18, 2016. <br>
          <br>
          Waterfalls Estates truly is "Your Own Private Paradise". No other property in Hawaii compares to Waterfalls Estates, now with 100+ photovoltaic solar panels. This heavenly retreat is simply incomparable in terms of panoramic views, privacy and security, the generous array of household and recreational amenities provided, the surrounding flora and fauna, quality of art, decor, furnishings, kitchen goods and linens, and entertainment options. In addition to all of the seriously decadent amenities provided, what we love most about Waterfalls Estates is the sense of peacefulness, tranquility, and calm serenity that you will feel when walking through the gardens, relaxing in the warm pools, or lounging on the supremely comfortable down-filled furniture.<br>
          <br>
          Most visitors to Maui start off asking to stay in a beachfront location. Over time, they learn that beachfront rental homes offer virtually no privacy and are often buffeted by strong afternoon trade winds. A smarter alternative is to rent Waterfalls Estates. It's easy to grab the abundant supplies provided and pop down to the beach for some sandy salt water fun, but after a few hours when the trades pick up and the sun heats up, there's nothing like retreating to Waterfalls Estates, your very own retreat and spa with shaded lawns, gardens and wind protected heated saline swimming pools. <br>
          <br>
          For beach lovers, there are more than a dozen sandy swimming beaches within minutes by car from Waterfalls Estates. Keawakapu Beach parking lot can be reached in just 2-3 minutes door-to-door. There is plentiful parking, sani facilities, and showers at the beach. Approx. 5-10 minutes away are Ulua Beach, Wailea Beach, Polo Beach, White Rock Beach, Chang's Beach and Big Beach. Travel up the coast in the other direction along a speedy highway and you'll find a string of gorgeous light golden sand beaches that are famous for their accessibility and good swimming conditions (weather depending), including Kamaole I "Charley Young Beach" and Kamaole II and III Beaches in Kihei. We encourage guests to get out and explore all of Maui's award-winning beaches, including Kaanapali Beach and Kapalua Beach, but most guests tell us "there's simply no place like home". Most beach parks have free public parking, showers, restrooms, and some picnic facilities. Several beach parks in nearby Kihei, Wailea Beach and Big Beach have lifeguards during fixed hours. A very generous supply of beach gear is stocked in the garage for guest use. Help yourself to the portable beach-use coolers, chairs, umbrellas, toys, towels, assorted boards, and more! <br>
          <br>
          The views from Waterfalls Estates stretch from Makena to Kahului, including the Wailea-Kihei coastline and the West Maui Mountains. On clear days you also see off-shore island dotting the expanse of big blue ocean below. Take in absolutely stunning golden sunsets and twinkling moonsets, or if you are an early riser enjoy the sun rising over Haleakala. At 650 feet elevation, Waterfalls Estates is blessed with slightly cooler daytime temperatures than along the beach area, with light and fresh trade wind breezes to moderate the afternoon temps. At night, a light cover up is sometimes needed as the evening air takes on a pinch of chill, but that's also when the jasmine and other floral fragrances are robustly noticeable - a great time for a walk in the garden under the stars or the moonlight. <br>
          <br>
          Waterfalls Estates is conveniently located between Kihei and Wailea. You can easily travel to The Grand Wailea Resort, The Four Seasons Resort, The Shops At Wailea, Kihei-Town, Numerous Championship Golf Courses, Tennis Courts, Beaches, Snorkeling Coves, Diving Spots, Surfing & Paddle Boarding Spots, Spas & Salons, Grocery Stores, and Dining & Shopping. <br>
          <br>
          Maui is encircled with a very rare marine sanctuary. Charter a boat for scuba diving, sailing, or snorkeling, or spend a day at one of our many golden sand beaches, and mother nature might put on a show for you. Often visible in near-shore waters are humpback whales, spinner or bottle-nosed dolphins, turtles, and endangered monk seals. It's not unusual to see whales breaching above the Pacific waters from any of the 7 ocean view rooms or the ocean view pool deck at Waterfalls Estates. <br>
          <br>
          Enter Waterfalls Estates (Your Own Private Heaven!) through the automatic wood gate and find yourself in a mystical other-worldly eden of lush tropical gardens with dense jungle-like greenery, meandering fresh water streams, and pastel blooming island flowers including multi-hued orchids growing in trees. The Waterfalls Estates garden is quite possibly the most decadent private organic arboretum or botanical garden in all of Hawaii. Pick your own fruit for breakfast or make banana bread - Waterfalls Estates tastes as good as it looks. <br>
          <br>
          A day in paradise begins with a gaze up at the dormant peak of Haleakala, a mesmerizing mountain that is usually bathed in the soft glow of Maui's delicate morning light. Take a warm up stroll through the beautiful gardens. Have a look at the bright orange, yellow, red and fucshia hibiscus, the pink and coral bougainvillea, and sunshine yellow and pretty pink plumeria. From high up in the bamboo and palms that outline this 2 acre estate, a symphony of bird song can be heard. Listen for the sweet serenade of 2 pairs of "married" resident cardinals, gray francolins, myna birds, spotted and zebra doves, finches, and mannikins. Hear water trickling along the Waterfalls Estates "River" and morning breezes from atop the mountain that rustle the palm fronds - your own private alarm clock. <br>
          <br>
          Who's making breakfast? Dine outdoors in the cool fresh morning air on the 2,000 square foot "mountain" side sun-shaded patio. Grab a coffee from the built-in Dacor coffee bar. Cook a perfect omelette on the Wolf gas range or use the Vitamix for smoothies. Actually, why stop there? Almost every imaginable small appliance and kitchen gadget is stocked for your cooking fun. The pool cabana BBQ is large enough to grill gourmet hot dogs or burgers or chicken breast for all 12 guests at one time. The popcorn maker can feed a whole theater. We suggest you organize a cooking competition for your own group when in residence and make good use of what looks like a full catalogue of goodies from "Williams-Sonoma" or better. <br>
          <br>
          Need a work out? Drop in to your very own fully equipped private home gym, located pool-side by the BBQ and Billiards Cabana. The air-conditioned gym features Precor brand state-of-art equipment such as 2 treadmills, elliptical trainer, large assortment of free weights, stationary bicycle, universal weight machine, Pilates Reformer machine, Yoga supplies, and two large HD televisions with surround-sound and the entertainment options. <br>
          <br>
          Ready to swim? You have 3 heated saline pools to choose from. Lap swim in the 52 foot two lane lower pool, take a dip in the free-form lagoon-style shallow oasis, slip into the extra-deep plunge pool, or take a break in the heated hot spa that is adorned with a cascading waterfall. You can also slide into the plunge pool or "hike" through the misty LED lit grotto that passes beneath another gorgeous cascading waterfall. The pools are heated to a minimum average of 84 degrees year-round. <br>
          <br>
          Need a break from Maui's gorgeous sunshine and warmer mid-day temps? Plop down on the sunken living room sofa and watch a movie or tv show on the 9.5 foot HD screen. Press a button to drop the sun shades. Before you know it, you might just be in slumber-land. We will let you figure out how to best enjoy "Pete's Bar". There's plenty of entertainment waiting for you there, just follow one of the drink recipe books, run one of the many blenders, toss in a paper umbrella (stocked - of course!), grab a custom printed Waterfalls Estates napkin and gulp down your favorite tropical refreshment. How about a drink mixing competition too? <br>
          <br>
          Other on-site entertainment might include a game of billiards, net games on the lower lawn (volleyball or badminton), or a round of poker with one million $ worth of casino-quality chips. Another great recreation is to play on Waterfalls Estates's championship quality Dwarf Seashore Paspalum grass 2,500 square foot 4 hole private putting green with two sand bunkers. Built to USGA standards and maintained at 9+ stimp, the putting green offers some serious putting practice. Putters, balls and baskets are stocked in the garage for your use. <br>
          <br>
          For a full round of golf try the scenic Wailea Gold, Emerald or Blue courses - just minutes away. Guests receive a special rate for golf. Just ask your friendly Personal Concierge to make tee-times in advance. Also, as a Waterfalls Estates guest, you have an opportunity to golf at The King Kamehameha Golf Club, one of only two private courses on Maui. As a Private Paradise Villas guest, you will receive a special limited time per player fee of $195 + tax in the mornings or $175 + tax in the afternoons. Limited tee times available, ask your Personal Concierge for reservations. The green fees for these limited starting times are regularly $225 and $205 plus tax. You are also invited to visit their Frank Lloyd Wright designed clubhouse adorned with exquisite Hawaiian art where lunch and massage service is available. <br>
          <br>
          After soaking up the rays of our brilliant sunsets and dinner on the alfresco patio, settle into one of the six spacious upper level bedroom suites. Four of the bedroom suites are ocean view bedrooms with king size beds, private terraces with lounging furniture, full ensuite bathrooms with deep soaking tubs, decadent sheeting and down pillows and comforters, and large screen TVs with full audio/video features including Apple TV, Netflix, CD/DVD capability, and HD Dish TV with plenty of extra sports and news channels. Two mountain view bedrooms offer flexible bedding. Request a king size bed or two twin size beds for each of the two mountain-view rooms prior to arrival. Each of the six bedroom suites are set up with all of the same indulgent goodies including down filled furniture, ultra-plush natural wool carpet, and a full entertainment system. Any of the six bedroom suites are wheelchair accessible via a beautiful brass and wood elevator. <br>
          <br>
          Conveniently situated between bedrooms 5 and 6 (the two twin or king rooms) is a "play room" that can also double as a nursery. There is plenty of room for a crib, pack 'n play, highchair, and other baby items. The play room is outfitted with sofas, a banquet, games, books and toys, a TV, iPod dock, Wii game, and much more. <br>
          <br>
          Tired of cooking in your stunning double chef's kitchen? Many of our favorite island dining spots are nearby and they all offer absolutely yummy food. They include Matteo's, Cuatro, Cafe O Lei, Gannon's, Longhi's, Manoli's, Monkeypod Kitchen, Tommy Bahama, Southshore Fish Market and many others. The Kihei area provides several casual but atmospheric clubs to enjoy pupus, drinks and live music, especially a triangle of bars and party spots near Foodland and Kalama Park. <br>
          <br>
          Don't miss Willie K when on island. He plays guitar and sings and entertains several nights each month at rotating venues. He's our equivalent of Prince or Brother Iz and is a legendary and virtuoso guitarist and vocalist in addition to having written some of the most heartfelt and beautiful melodies in contemporary Hawaiian music. Call Your Personal Concierge for information and advance reservations. </p>
