          <h1 align="left">Edge of Paradise, St. Thomas, Caribbean Vacation Rental</h1>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">The Edge of Paradise is a true gem and a one-of-a-kind getaway villa. Nestled on the edge of world-renown Magen’s Bay in St. Thomas, it is a unique combination of charm, luxury and privacy. The secluded and natural beauty of this property are what make it so extraordinary. The property includes approximately five-hundred feet of prime ocean frontage and its own beach, just a walk down the steps. The villa looks over a pristine coral reef that flourishes in these crystal clear Caribbean waters, teeming with life. There are very few rental homes in all of the Virgin Islands that can compare to our property as a charming and luxurious tropical retreat, with its own secluded beach and reef, and none on Magen’s Bay. As such, it is a very special place for families to unwind and share a memorable vacation.
<br /><br />
The Edge of Paradise is designed to be a family-friendly getaway destination. The villa has four spacious bedrooms, each with en suite bathrooms, and will comfortably accommodate ten people . The furnishings and artwork are reflective of a beach house decor, and the beds and mattresses are  top quality. The master bedroom is quite sizable, extending across the entire length of the home, and offers its most stunning ocean views. The master en-suite bathroom is luxurious and charming. Behind the master bedroom is the second bedroom and en-suite bathroom, furnished with three twin beds so that families with children can have their kids be nearby. This second bedroom also has an ocean view via an attached balcony, and a door for passage to a lovely courtyard. Versatility is prioritized,  as the master bedroom also has a sitting area with a sofa-bed that can be opened for small children, and two upscale roll out beds a closet away. The downstairs bedroom suite, which is quite spacious and has a king bed and a matching twin bed, has an attached porch that is closer to the ocean than any other room. The detached cottage suite has a queen bed, is similarly very private and inviting, and also provides ocean views.
<br /><br />
The villa has a gourmet kitchen and an especially large farmhouse dining table to assure a large group can comfortably share meals together.  A spacious pantry attaches to the kitchen, and is equipped with useful cooking appliances and tools. Two large refrigerators allow guests the opportunity to stock up on food and drink supplies for their entire stay with one trip to the grocery store.  Alternatively, our guests can have the refrigerators filled with their choice of supplies immediately prior to arrival, for a small concierge fee.
<br /><br />
The great room has a panoramic view of the ocean and multiple French doors that allow inside and outside to mesh smoothly.  A collection of DVDs and Netflix are available for indoor entertainment on the large flat screen TV.  An IPod dock allows our guests to play music of their choice over the sound system. Wi-Fi is available and cellphone reception is good for all carriers our guests have used (AT&T, Virgin Mobile, and Verizon).<br /><br />
Just outside the kitchen is a charming outdoor kitchen which sits beneath a trellised pergola.  This secondary kitchen includes a coral stone dining table, a stainless propane grill and a spectacular and versatile pizza oven. Made of native island fieldstone, this oven is powered by either firewood or propane.
<br /><br />
Our views of the stunning waters of Magen’s Bay are truly exceptional. Magen’s Bay is a treasured Virgin Island nature preserve and, as such, has no hotels nearby and very limited residential development on its shores, particularly its western shore. Magen’s Bay Beach is a magnificent natural landmark that stretches for over a mile along the south end of the bay, renowned for its white sand and turquoise waters. This beach is depicted above, on the right side. Behind the beach stands a tropical  forest, which gradually rises up a mountain, filled with lush vegetation and fascinating wildlife. This beach was recognized as one of the top ten beaches in the entire world  by National Geographic. The beach is meticulously maintained by the Magen’s Bay Authority and offers watersport rentals, food and drink cabanas, picnic shelters, and a spectacular nature trail that extends from the beach area to the mountaintop.  An abundant variety of exotic tropical flora and fauna imported from around the world thrives there, and is identified with signage.
<br /><br />
Edge of Paradise villa sits on the west side of the bay. The villa  is the most proximate residence to Magen’s Bay Beach on the western shore, just a short kayak paddle away. approximately half a mile. Yet, because a dense tropical forest and a rugged rocky shoreline span between our villa and that beach, the villa is secluded.  The clarity of the water is excellent for snorkeling, and the water calm for swimming. There is a coral reef thriving along the western side of the bay. This reef is quite isolated and not readily accessible to beach tourists, and so it remains pristine. No other reef exists in the bay; the rest of the bay is sandy. It is quite uncommon to have a secluded spot where adults and kids can wade out into an ocean that has a colorful and fascinating reef right there to explore, in clear Caribbean waters that deepen very gradually .
<br /><br />
Immediately to the north of the villa, and on the property belonging to the villa, is another beach. Unlike the white sands of Magen’s Bay Beach, this beach is pebbly yet beautiful in its own way. It is exquisitely private and affords an easy access point for kayaking, paddle boarding, fishing, snorkeling or swimming. It is also sometimes used for small romantic campfires at night. Due to the presence of the reef, the marine ecosystem there is abundantly thriving, both under the water and above it. Pelicans will dive in and bring up proof of the abundant fish there, or you can snorkel and see for yourself!
<br /><br />
All three stories of the villa have roofed decks that look out right over the sparkling waters of Magen’s Bay, where this long coral reef extends to within a few feet of the shore. As alluded to previously, the reef is undisturbed and is abounding with colorful sea life. Minutes can turn into hours when observing the pelicans. Majestic sea creatures like turtles and eagle rays are sometimes seen from the villa, over and within the reef. Even dolphin and whale sightings have been reported in the bay, beyond the reef.
<br /><br />
Spectacular as the wildlife views can be, many families have found the most important view afforded from our villa is that of their children safely enjoying the ocean. Indeed, a number of moms have commented that, while they loved many things about the villa, their favorite feature was the ability to directly observe their children in the water from the villa’s decks and to see how the water tended to be so much calmer and clearer than elsewhere.
<br /><br />
Parrots cackle in the lush tropical foliage overhead, and iguanas  move about between the trees and bushes. Besides the three attached porch decks, the villa has beautiful water decks which sit just above the ocean surface, connected via stairs. This provides easy access to the private beach. But perhaps the most alluring spot for taking in the breathtaking views is from the large coral stone deck that spans between the villa and the cottage. The coral stone was chosen because of its beauty and its resistance to heat buildup in the sun. Within this area sits an “infinity” swimming pool which has a specially contoured bench seat that faces the Caribbean.  A custom made fieldstone hot tub emanates above the coral stone next to the pool.
<br /><br />
A 4 Wheel Drive Vehicle is recommended for this villa.
