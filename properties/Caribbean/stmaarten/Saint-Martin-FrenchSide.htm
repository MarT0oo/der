          <p><strong>Experience the paradise of Saint Martin </strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">St. Martin/Saint Marteen is a Caribbean Island located 186 miles East of Puerto Rico.  The area, discovered by Christopher Columbus, was named by him on his initial visit, naming it after the Saint Martin of Tours Feast.  The Island is cut into sections, one French side and one Dutch side.  People come from far and wide to visit this amazing Island which boasts over 1,000,000 visitors per year.  The Island is rich with restaurants, amazing scenery, nude beaches and family beaches, shopping and nightlife.  Truly a great place to spend quality time with friends and family.  This Island also has an airport, the Princess Juliana International Airport, which has direct flights coming in from various countries.

            <br>
            People who have visited and stayed at local villas often say how the St. Martin area is well known for its cuisine, with culinary creations from Italian foods to local Caribbean favorites.  You can try Antoines and feast on Lobster or visit Temptation Bar and Restaurant and enjoy a bit of night life and fantastic culinary treats. If you prefer something more casual, try Bavaria Restaurant where you are always promised great service.  No matter what you choose, St. Martin has great eating for everyone, even the kids. <br>
            <br>
            If you are going to St. Martin for the nightlife, you will absolutely enjoy Opal Night Club, offering the best in dancing, drinks and entertainment year round.  If you are looking for something to do with the whole family or just to bring your friends to a laid back night time bar, try Philipsburg Theater where you can find movies, drinking, and plenty of activities. <br>
            <br>
            Nobody rents a beachfront villa just for the Island Activities and we know that, most people come for the weather and the beaches.  Our beaches happen to be some of the most beautiful in the world, from the Great Bay Beach on the Dutch side to the Baie Longue on the French side and from there you can try Guana, Maho, Happy Bay, Simpson Bay, Anse Marcel, Mullett Bay, Friars Bay, Nettle Bay, Orient Beach, Baie Rouge or any of over a dozen spectacular beaches.  No matter where you rent that vacation home you are always just a few minutes to one of the Island beaches. <br>
            <br>
