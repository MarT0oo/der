            Traveling Around Antigua: Rental cars are abundant throughout Antigua. You will need a valid national license and a local license. A local license may be obtained at a police station for a nominal charge of US$20. Be aware that driving is on the left-hand side and most of the island roadways are not paved.

Travel by bus only if you don't mind erratic bus schedules and limited destinations. Taxis are the easiest way to venture around Antigua and all taxi drivers are qualified tour guides. For the adventuresome traveler, consider renting a motorcycle or mountain bike to see the island.<br />

            <strong>Jumby Bay Wildlife</strong> <br />
            Nature abounds on Jumby Bay Island. During your stay with us, you may observe a variety of bird life, including our mascot, the White Egret, the playful Bananaquit and nature's marvel, the Blue Pelican. Pasture Bay Beach is one of the world's principal nesting sites for the endangered Hawksbill Sea Turtle (July through November). Jumby Bay homeowners have set aside prime beachfront to ensure the continued protection of the nesting site for the turtle whose ancestors have inhabited the area's waters since the Age of Dinosaurs. During November, the harmless Nurse Shark uses the shallow waters off Pasture Bay Beach as a mating ground, coming into shore just shy of the beach following age-old instincts. This, combined with the presence of Eagle Rays, schooling fish and an adundance of reef fish make the waters surrounding Jumby Bay a haven for snorkelers. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>History</strong> <br />
            The earliest inhabitants of Jumby Bay Island were South American Indians, beginning with the Siboney who arrived here about 1775 BC. Most came to the island to mine flint, which was exported to other islands for the manufacture of primitive tools and weapons. Around 50 AD, the Arawaks arrived to Jumby Bay but were in turn displaced by the Caribs, an Indian tribe that continued to raid the island until 1674, at which time English settlers had replaced the Spaniards who colonized the island in the 1500s. <br />
            <br />
            The first European to discover the island was Christopher Columbus, an Italian sailing under Spanish colors in 1493. King Charles I granted Jumby Bay Island to Earl of Carlisle, the first recorded owner in 1627. In 1835 a Mr. Jarvis (owner of Jumby Bay at that time) rented the island to emancipated slaves who grew provisions to sell on Antigua. In 1935 an heir to the property used Jumby Bay to raise sheep. These sheep were descendants from those brought to the island by Spanish settlers who lived on the island in the 16th Century. The wild sheep seen roaming on Jumby Bay today are descendants of those sheep. <br />
            <br />
            Jumby Bay was uninhabited for more than four decades before work began in the 1980s. In 1983 Jumby Bay opened as a private resort. Rosewood Hotels & Resorts assumed management of the resort in April 2002. <br><br>&nbsp;</p>
