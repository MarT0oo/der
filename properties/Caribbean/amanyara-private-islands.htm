          <p><strong>Welcome to Amanyara Resort Villa, Turks &amp; Caicos</strong><br><br><a href="turkscaicos/amanyara-vacation-villas.htm" class="color4"><strong>Click here to view Amanyara Resort Villas, Turks &amp; Caicos Vacation Properties</strong></a><br><br>Amanyara offers a contemporary setting in sensual tropical  harmony that befits its island host. Pavilions and villas are scattered across  tropical vegetation and ponds, perched on rugged stone headlands and rests  steps from an endless fine-sand alabaster beach. Located at the edge of the  Caribbean Sea on the island of Turks and Caicos in the British West Indies, the  resort is a private and exclusive hideaway with a turquoise Atlantic Ocean  teaming with spectacular diving opportunities. It provides the perfect  opportunity to savour authentic tropical paradise.<br><br><strong>The Resort </strong><br><br>Amanyara (peaceful place) is located on the coast of  Northwest Point adjacent to Malcolm&rsquo;s Beach on the island of Providenciales (or  Provo as it is referred to locally). The island is one of the Turks and Caicos  Islands, part of the British West Indies. The resort derives its name from  aman, the Sanskrit word for &lsquo;peace&rsquo;, and yara, the word for &lsquo;place&rsquo; in the  language of the Arawak Amerindians, one of the region&rsquo;s first indigenous  peoples. It enjoys a pristine location well removed from much of the  development on the eastern side of the island.<br><br>From its secluded white-sand beach and unusual ironshore  rocky coves, to the abundant marine life of its pristine reef walls, Amanyara  embraces Northwest Point Marine National Park, an acclaimed area of 1,686  hectares (4,168 acres) that provides some of the world&rsquo;s best wall and reef  diving.<br><br>Entry to the resort is through a large reception pavilion  that opens onto a central reflecting pond. Surrounded by mahogany trees, the  pond is framed on one side by the Library and Boutique and on the other side by  the Restaurant and Bar. The circular Bar offers a dramatic soaring roof and sea  views fronted by the 50-metre (164-foot) main swimming pool and sun deck.<br><br><strong>Details</strong><br><br>The Restaurant provides a choice of dining settings. It is  divided into two areas, one open to sea breezes and the other air-conditioned.  The open setting leads down to a terrace with outdoor seating scattered beneath  two large trees. Both areas have sweeping views of the ocean. The second area  can be closed to provide air-conditioned dining in the hotter months and also  opens to an outdoor balcony that enjoys views across the central reflecting  pond. The cuisine focuses on classic Asian and modern Mediterranean dishes with  an emphasis on fresh seafood.<br><br>Beyond the Restaurant and leading to the swimming pool is  The Bar. The structure is circular in design and features a soaring ceiling. It  includes a central service bar with a number of oversized lounging daybeds on  its perimeter. Leading from The Bar is a spacious terrace that provides  informal dining throughout the day and more large lounging beds. The Bar is  also the ideal venue for sipping exotic fruit cocktails or aperitifs while  watching the sun set, or for enjoying an after-dinner cigar or nightcap.  Afternoon tea is served daily.<br><br>Located on a dune above the southern end of the sweeping  800-metre (2,625-foot) white sand beach, the Beach Club provides a casual  dining venue throughout the day and most evenings. A choice in seating is  available from the elevated interior to the bar front, or the lower terrace  that leads to an expansive timber deck. Beyond lies the Dive Pavilion, Nature  Discovery Centre and wooden pathway to the beach. A simple menu offers flavours  of Asia and the Mediterranean with casual beach fare and showcases dishes fired  in a stone hearth oven. Afternoon cooking demonstrations paired with wine or  rum tastings are held several times throughout the year.<br><br>The swimming pool is located within an expansive terrace  that provides uninterrupted views of the ocean. Measuring 50 by 8 metres (164  by 26 feet), two lounging salas on either end offer shallow entry to the pool.  A third lounging sala is located beyond the pool and closer to the oceanfront.  Pairs of sunloungers are positioned along the timber deck and an outdoor shower  area is provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The Library, with its reading terrace overlooking the  central reflecting pond, offers a wide selection of coffee table books along  with travel guides, novels and reference materials. Newspapers, magazines, CDs,  DVDs, board games and internet access are also available.&nbsp; Adjacent to the  Library is the Boutique which offers a variety of resort wear, jewellery, art  work, souvenirs and vacation essentials.<br><br>The multimedia Screening Room features 30 wide leather seats  and is fully equipped with a DVD and VHS player, Cable TV, high speed internet  and video/data projection capabilities.&nbsp; Overlooking the tennis courts,  the gym features a range of cardiovascular equipment and resistance training  machines. A personal trainer can be arranged for private sessions.<br><br>Overlooking a large reflection pond and lush vegetation, the  Spa is Amanyara&rsquo;s wellness facility spread over one and a half acres. Featuring  four double treatment pavilions and a reception and relaxation pavilion, the  Spa offers a variety of massages, wraps, scrubs, facials and beauty treatments.  Private yoga or Pilates sessions can also be arranged.<br><br>Regular complimentary morning yoga classes are held at the  Spa's outdoor yoga sala. An indoor and outdoor camp adjacent to Amanyara&rsquo;s  beach where visiting marine and natural history educators conduct programs  which enhance the experience of younger guests. The centre also offers a  shallow pool for young children.&nbsp; There are two floodlit Har-tru clay  tennis courts. Tennis racquets, balls and shoes are provided and lessons or  game partners can be arranged.&nbsp; Wireless broadband connections are  available in all accommodations and the Library.<br><br><strong>Travel Information</strong><br><br>Climate: The Turks and Caicos benefit from the cooling  effects of trade winds from the Southeast Equatorial Current. The islands boast  a subtropical climate, similar to that of the Bahamas, though slightly warmer  and drier. The dry season generally runs from November to May with scattered  showers from June to October. During the cooler months from December through  March, the average daily high temperature is approximately 26째C (80째F) which  coincides with the peak season. The hotter months are June through October,  when the daily average high is 32째C (90째F).<br><br>Language: English is the official language and is spoken by  most people.<br><br>Currency: The Turks and Caicos is unique in that it is a  British Overseas Territory with the US dollar as the official currency.<br><br>Immigration Requirements: For stays up to 30 days, no visas  are required for citizens of the USA, Canada, UK and EU countries. Most other  nationalities require a visa. All nationalities, including US and UK citizens,  will need to show a passport valid for at least six months. Proof of onward  transportation is also required upon entry.<br><br>Health: The Turks and Caicos is free of malaria, yellow  fever and other irksome tropical diseases and in general, hygiene conditions  are very good. No vaccinations are required. The sun can be very strong, and a  suitable sunscreen is recommended. A mosquito repellent may be needed in the  evenings from time to time. There are two private medical centres and a  full-service hospital managed by InterHealth Canada on the island.<br><br>Mobile Phones: Quad-band (850hz) mobile phones are the most  compatible in Turks and Caicos Islands, although most mobile phones will work.<br><br>Travel Tips: Electrical current is 110 volts AC, 60 cycles,  suitable for all US appliances. The Turks and Caicos is on Eastern Standard  Time (EST), five hours behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and observes Daylight  Saving Time from March to October. During the winter months (December to March)  a light sweater may be required in the evenings.<br><br>Our Villas are Especially Private and Catered so you will  always be taken care of.&nbsp; Each Villa sits on more than half a hectare (1쩍  acres) of lush terrain and emulates on a more intimate scale the Amanyara  resort as a whole. The three, four or five-bedroom Villas are situated either along  the oceanfront, overlooking a tranquil pond or nestled in island vegetation.  Some showcase internal reflecting ponds.<br><br>The Villas are centered by either a rectangular or square  infinity-edged swimming pool in black volcanic rock surrounded by extensive  hardwood decking. The free-standing bedroom pavilions are similar to those of  the resort, some with outdoor bathtubs and showers. A few Villas have an  additional bedroom suitable for up to four children and a nanny. A large living  and dining pavilion, outdoor dining sala and fully-equipped kitchen are  included in each Villa.<br><br>A personal cook and housekeeper take care of all guest  needs. Villas come with two four-seater golf buggies, and guests may enjoy  access to the resort&rsquo;s facilities and services.<br><br>Every aspect of the operation of the villas is overseen by  staff management, general maintenance, security, housekeeping, gardening and  guest amenities.</p>
