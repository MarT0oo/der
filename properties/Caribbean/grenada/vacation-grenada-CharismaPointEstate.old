          Located on the beautiful island of Grenada with easy daily flights from the USA, and frequent flights from Europe this beautiful property is very private.

Situated on a privately owned peninsula, it is a 6.5 acre gated Estate with 24/7 security. Grenada is one of the safest Caribbean Islands with very little crime but this Owner values her privacy and security. <br>

          The fully gated property has its own generators, private desalination plant and water filtration systems. The estate is capable of running completely ‘off grid’.

There is fantastic snorkeling directly from the property and the dock provides a wonderful backdrop for hundreds of colorful tropical fish. <br>
          <br>
          Charisma Point Estate has 2 boats for guest use (with Captain) and this is at additional rate plan. The 31 foot motor cruiser has an onboard fresh water shower and toilet and is perfect for exploring and fishing while the 19 foot jet boat is perfect for all watersports. The property has extensive water sports facilities including wakeboard, knee board, kayaks, tubes and lots of fun toys such as floating islands (with their own bar!) that can be attached to the dock. The Owner owns the dredging rights to the Bay around the property and there is a 150 foot privacy cordon from the water side of the property. There are 3 luxury vehicles for guest use (with driver) including a 12 seater luxury minibus, two 7 seater SUV’s. <br>
          <br>
          Guests who recently booked this property did not leave at all for 10 days, the property really has it all! However if you want to explore the beautiful Island there is a full concierge service available and plenty to see and do. </p>
