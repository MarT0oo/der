        <h1>Stone House, Governor's Harbour, Eleuthera, Bahamas Vacation Rental</h1><br>
          <p align="left">This lovingly restored 19th century cottage features natural oak floors and high ceilings. It is furnished with a literal treasure trove of unique pieces from around the world. You enter Stone House into the spacious living room. There is a large loft bedroom above it, accessed by a short flight of steps. The loft has twin beds, a sitting area, and a dramatic cathedral ceiling. Pass through the living room to the dining room and fully equipped kitchen featuring state-of-the-art stainless steel appliances. There is also a full bath on this level with walk-in shower.
<br><br>
The master bedroom is accessed down a flight of stairs. It has a king bed and beautifully appointed en suite bathroom with shower and tub.
<br><br>
The house has two large and lovely shaded porches, which have dining and sitting areas. Stone House shares a pool with two other houses.You will be surrounded by a lush garden which is home to many fruit trees, bougainvillea, hibiscus, aloe and coconut palms.
<br><br>
Amenities include flat-screen cable TV, air conditioning, ceiling fan, wireless internet, hi-fi stereo, cordless telephone, and off-street parking.
<br><br>
Stone House is part of the Squires Estate collection of beautifully restored 19th century homes on the hill above Governors Harbour. The homes and cottages of Squires Estate were restored and furnished with antiques by a reknowned Italian architect. The décor and level of finish will delight the most discriminating world traveler. Our manager will greet you upon arrival and be available to assist you as needed. She can arrange for daily housekeeping, a private chef, or a car rental (extra charges apply), and provide advice about island activities. Other staff at Squires Estate include a fulltime gardener and housekeepers. Laundry and ironing services are provided on the premises. Stone House can be combined with other historic homes and cottages in the Squires Estate collection for larger groups.
<br><br>
The town of Governors Harbour, a one-minute walk down the hill, has a charming collection of 19th century homes and churches overlooking its historic harbor. Buy fresh fish and lobster every afternoon from fisherman at the town dock, or visit the recently restored Haynes Library, which dates from 1897, for the weekly coffee hour for foreign residents and tourists. Governors Harbour has grocery stores, restaurants, liquor stores, two banks with ATMs, a bakery, gift shops, a dive shop, and a medical clinic. Friday Night Fish Fry in Governors Harbour, a street/beach party that brings together all the tourists and locals with food, drink, and dancing in the street, is not to be missed.
<br><br>
Walking over the hill in the other direction takes you to French Leave Beach, the finest beach on the island and one of the great beaches of the Caribbean. By foot, it’s about 10 minutes to French Leave, a mile-long crescent of pink sand which is literally deserted most of the time. Most visitors to Eleuthera rent a car, because the island is rural and spread out, and a car is the only practical way to get around. By car, Stone House is just a minute from French Leave Beach.
<br><br>
FREE FLIGHT: A stay of four nights or longer entitles you to one free round-trip ticket from Nassau to Eleuthera or flight credits from the U.S. Some restrictions apply. THIS PROMOTION IS RUN BY THE MINISTRY OF TOURISM AND IS NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE. Please contact us for details.
<br><br>
Eleuthera is famous for its 100 miles of spectacular, deserted beaches. The island, home to just 8000 residents, is completely safe any time of the day or night. The snorkeling, diving, and fishing on the island are world class. Boating, surfing, and other water sports are also popular. You can rent power boats, sailboats, sea kayaks, bikes. You can have a charter captain take you out for excursions of various types. Eleuthera has vast caves, cliffs, a bottomless ocean hole, many unique beaches.
