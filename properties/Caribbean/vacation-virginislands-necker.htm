        <h1>Necker Island, British Virgin Island Vacation Rental</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Necker, Sir Richard Bransonâ€™s private island paradise, is situated in the British Virgin Islands, a stunning and unspoilt area of the Caribbean. At 74 acres, Necker sits in turquoise waters surrounded by coral reefs and fringed with beautiful white sandy beaches. Necker can become your own private hideaway; away from the stresses and strains of daily life. The island can be hired exclusively for groups of up to 30 people, or if you're not looking to hire it exclusively, you can still enjoy the Necker experience during Celebration Weeks when individual rooms can be booked by singles or couples to enjoy our fabulous island paradise â€™house partyâ€™ style. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Accommodation on Necker Island:</strong> Accommodation on Necker Island includes nine bedrooms in the Great House and six individual Bali Houses dotted around the island. There is also a bunkroom in the Great House that sleeps up to six children. All rooms have private en-suite bathrooms. The total number of guests that be accommodated on Necker Island is 30 plus six children in the bunkroom. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>The Great House:</strong> The brand new, spacious al fresco style Balinese villa is due for completion in late 2013 and boasts amazing panoramic views of the Caribbean, the Atlantic and neighbouring islands. Each of the eight guest rooms has a balcony, and all come with king-size beds and en-suite bathrooms. On the upper level youâ€™ll find the Master Suite, complete with private outdoor Jacuzzi and outdoor bath. All rooms have king size beds which can be split into twin beds in most cases. All rooms in the Great House are fully air-conditioned. <br />
          <br />
          The Great House is the place where people come together, and has an expansive outdoor terrace with hammocks and sofas. Thereâ€™s a state-of-the art kitchen where our resident chefs prepare their famous dishes and a large dining table for everyone to gather round to enjoy their meal. There is also a fully-stocked bar where our team can make you your favourite cocktails, or you can just help yourself! For a bit of fun thereâ€™s also a snooker table, piano, lots of comfortable sofas and cushions, an entertainment system with a large range of CDs and DVDs, and guest computers with internet access. Up on the roof youâ€™ll find a cosy four-person Jacuzzi â€“ perfect for sipping champagne as you watch the sun set. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>The Bali Houses:</strong> These six beautiful private houses are built in authentic Balinese style and each can accommodate a couple and both Bali Beach and Bali Buah can be split into twins. Some of the Bali Houses are split levels complete with a meditation room. Bali Hi, Bali Cliff and Bali Beach are built on a cliff in order to maximise views, sea breezes and the sounds of the sea. They are nestled together with one shared plunge pool but all with private en-suite bathrooms. Bali Cliff has a stunning fully open-air bathroom. Bali Beach as you might expect overlooks the beach! Bali Lo, Bali Buah and Bali Kukila are built in the middle of the island and boast wonderful views with a large private pool. All Bali Houses have home entertainment systems with iPod docking leads and all are fully air-conditioned. <br />

          <br />
          <strong>The Beaches:</strong> There are plenty of places to lie on the beach and enjoy the sea. Main Beach is where most of our water activities are based and where you will find the Tennis and Beach Pavilion plus an aqua-trampoline anchored to the sea floor. Turtle Beach is a more peaceful palm-fringed beach, with hammocks hanging between the trees. There are many other places where guests can find a peaceful spot to relax and the more energetic can take the two-hour walk around the island to view the flora and fauna.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Water Activities</strong> - We have a large selection of state of the art equipment, enabling us to provide guests with the opportunity to try kite-surfing, sailing, windsurfing, water skiing, kayaking, power boat trips and plenty more. We also provide snorkelling equipment for those who want to go out and blow some bubbles with Necker's underwater wildlife! The watersports building is located right on the main beach and not only is it a perfect place to find all the water toys you need, but it is also somewhere to take it easy and enjoy the views! There is a decking area with chairs for spectators and even a hammock so you donâ€™t have to be involved in the sports to come down and join the action. Not only do we have plenty of equipment in a fantastic location, but we also have highly qualified instructors who are all very eager to give you the chance to try all the sports that we have available.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>The Beach Pavilion:</strong> Located in the Main Beach area, here guests have access to two floodlit tennis courts and a viewing deck. The Beach Pavilion has an expansive communal area on the ground floor, with an impressive bar, lots of seating, space for game tables, and a huge sofa that is 26 feet long - thatâ€™s 8 metres! The sofa is positioned in front of a massive flat screen TV - perfect for catching up on the latest DVDs or for just relaxing in the shade when the sunâ€™s at its hottest. The upper floor is designed for communal dining, with a large table and some great views out onto the tennis courts on one side and out to sea on the other!<br />
          <br />
          <strong>The Pools:</strong> The Pool Pavilion has one of the most stunning pools around! This is located at Main Beach and can be accessed from both land and beach sides. There is a swim-up bar off the freeform infinity pool complete with rocks in the pool where guests can sit and enjoy a drink plus a huge Jacuzzi right on the beach with space for more than 20 people! Within the pool complex is our thatched Crocodile Pavilion, complete with a large solid teak crocodile table where guests can be served fresh food from the Pavilionâ€™s gourmet kitchen. There is also an infinity pool at the Great House and a private pool shared by Bali Lo, Bali Buah and Bali Kukila. Bali Hi, Bali Cliff & Bali Beach all share a plunge pool.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Tennis</strong>: Also located in the Main Beach area; here guests have access to two floodlit courts. Equipment is provided, although enthusiasts may wish to bring their own. We also have a professional tennis coach who is normally resident at Necker for those who wish to perfect their game and also arrange tournaments.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Spa Treatments</strong>: Leha Leha is the Balinese way of describing peace, relaxation and daydreaming, and there is no better place to experience this than with a spa treatment on Necker Island Spa. We have two fully trained resident beauty therapists offering a fabulous range of treatments. These are not included in our normal rates and a treatment list is available on request.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Food & Drink:</strong> Fine food is the highlight of any guests stay and our rates are fully inclusive of all food and all beverages, including champagne. Our wonderful chefs prepare food that we have become famous for and it is up to guests whether they want to dine on lobster and caviar or a Sunday roast! Dining can be formal or informal, inside or outside, themed or traditional or a mixture of everything! We stock a fine range of international wines, top quality spirits, international beers and excellent house champagne. If you would like us to ship in something special, simply give us plenty of notice (generally there is no extra charge unless the item is particularly rare or extra shipping is involved). No limit is placed on the amount of food or Children - Richard Branson designed Necker Island to be his familyâ€™s holiday home and his own children spent almost all of their school holidays there since they were infants, therefore it is no surprise that Necker Island is child friendly. The only time where Necker is best left to the grownups is during our couple-only Celebration Weeks where itâ€™s time for the adults to enjoy themselves! We do, however, have special Family Fun Weeks, when whole families are welcome on island.<br />
          <br />
          On Necker there are plenty of things for children to do; we have a large range of childrenâ€™s DVDs, toys, books and games. There are all of our usual activities however we can also arrange activities such as treasure hunts or beach Olympics. We have cots, baby baths and babysitting is provided at an additional cost. Childrenâ€™s meals can be provided any time. Guests can bring their own diapers and formula or let us know in advance what they will need and we will make sure we have it in time for their arrival.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Weddings & Honeymoons</strong> - It is hard to think of a better place to get married and we love weddings on Necker. Please contact your Reservations Office for more information. We are also an ideal location for a romantic honeymoon in paradise, Celebration Weeks are ideal for this too as it is not necessary for a couple to hire the entire Island.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Birthdays, Anniversaries & Other Celebrations</strong> - We can arrange practically anything to help mark a special occasion â€“ fireworks, hundreds of balloons, a non-stop feast; you tell us what you want and weâ€™ll make it happen.
