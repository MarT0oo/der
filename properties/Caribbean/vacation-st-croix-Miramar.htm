        <h1>Miramar,  Christiansted, St. Croix Vacation Rental</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Miramar is a one of a kind luxurious private estate perched on a bluff overlooking the Caribbean Sea. The former Appleton Estate, featured in Elite Traveler's 2017 Top Ten Villas in the Caribbean, the villa-mansion, located in a most extraordinary seafront setting is custom designed to luxuriously integrate comfort and elegance. This impressive custom mansion is beautifully rendered with every attention to detail throughout, integrating design and comfort with elegant custom features and perfectly melding polished formal elements with a casual, low-maintenance island attitude. Privileged guests can relax, completely at ease, within the fully air-conditioned grandeur of this superb four-bedroom villa, or outside on the terraces and patios cooled by sea breezes. At the end of a private road, secluded and secure behind an electronic gate, Miramar is perched on a bluff overlooking the ocean's edge where the sky meets the Caribbean Sea, blending with the elements in perfect harmony. <br>
          <br>
          Located in Estate Solitude on St. Croix's northeast shore, Miramar welcomes guests beneath a high-columned portico entry graced with a burbling fountain. Enter Miramar's breathtaking 2,400-square-foot Great Room, overlooking grand unobstructed views of the ocean and Buck Island. The Great Room features columns supporting high coffered ceilings and cool Italian marble floors accented with oriental area rugs, and encompasses a plush living area with a 70-inch LED TV with Surround Sound, an elegant formal dining area, an 18-foot granite-topped wet bar with an icemaker and beverage coolers, which looks out to sea, and an impressive gourmet kitchen. There's also a Yamaha electronic piano for your entertainment. <br>
          <br>
          The kitchen showcases black granite countertops and custom cabinetry, efficiently designed and complete with warming drawers. It is impressively equipped with top Wolf, Sub-Zero and Asko appliances and a bounty of cook's tools. <br>
          <br>
          The Great Room is beautifully enhanced by sparkling crystal chandeliers, sculpture and superb lighting throughout. Just off the dining area and kitchen, through arched doorways, are the powder room and laundry. <br>
          <br>
          French doors on either side of the bar open out to Miramar's heated pool and sun terrace set with cushioned chairs, sofas and tables under a columned shady covered area, perfect for alfresco dining and cocktails with music, and a stainless steel gas grill. There's also ample open space for sun worshippers to lounge and tan in the tropical sun. The memorable tableau of blue sky and blue sea extend beyond the pool terrace; you'll relish the unparalleled views of famous Buck Island in the near distance, and the parade of passing yachts and kite surfers. Internet coverage is available in villa, deck and pool area. <br>
          <br>
          In Miramar's east wing is the air-conditioned king master suite, a spacious and sumptuous room with a sitting area and most delightful ocean and Buck Island views. The ensuite bath of this lavish suite features separate "his and hers" vanities, enclosed WCs, dressing areas and custom walk-in closets with drawers and plentiful space. These "his and hers" areas are separated by a central glassed-in shower and a jacuzzi bathtub. French doors open from this suite directly to the pool terrace just outside. <br>
          <br>
          From this master suite, stairs descend within Miramar's east wing to two queen bedrooms, both air-conditioned and with satellite TV. Both bedrooms offer solar shades on windows and doors. These two queen bedrooms offer delightful sea views and ensuite baths with separate toilets. The first queen bed has an ornate inlaid wood headboard, and the second queen bed features an artistic scrolled metal bedstead. Both bedrooms share a bi-level patio just outside their french doors, overlooking sea grapes, palms, allamanda, bougainvillea and the ocean. <br>
          <br>
          A few more stairs brings you down to Miramar's air-conditioned workout room with satellite TV, cushioned rubber flooring and a NordicTrack treadmill, an elliptical strider, recumbent bike and free weights. You'll hardly notice time passing with the striking ocean and Buck Island views before you. <br>
          <br>
          Back on Miramar's main level, in the west wing is the second king master bedroom. This extraordinary air-conditioned ocean-view suite features a sunken living area with satellite TV, and french doors which open directly to the pool and terrace. The ensuite bath boasts double vanity sinks, a glassed-in shower stall, a jacuzzi tub, and a separate WC. <br>
          <br>
          Just off the second master suite is the air-conditioned library/office, a very handsome room in which to work, if you must, or to relax and have a quiet read. A generous library of books and a sitting area add to this room's cozy comfort. <br>
          <br>
          Expansive Miramar is contained all under one roof, and showcases creative design with its rooms always oriented to the sea. French doors topped with eyebrow windows artfully frame the stunning blue views; clever louvered wood panels in each room slide back and forth at a touch to perfectly adjust the natural light to your taste. Craftsman-quality custom cabinetry, tile work, colorful original art throughout and stunning designer furnishings elevate this substantial property to an impressive and finely-finished level. Gold fixtures and Miramar-monogrammed towels and bathrobes adorn each bath. <br>
          <br>
          For luxury travelers looking for a luxurious vacation experience with a bounty of amenities and comfort in an secluded and sublime location landscaped with rich tropical flora, superb Miramar is THE villa choice on St. Croix! <br>
          <br>
          Please Note: Miramar's discreet and charming on-site manager, Jamie, lives in an apartment below Miramar with a separate entrance. She's mostly off premises but available should you need her for maintenance, an emergency, or for seasoned island advice on anything else you might want to know. Jamie’s apartment does not look on to the pool terrace or in to any living area of Miramar and her vehicle is parked in another area of the driveway by a second garage.Your vacation privacy and peace are, of course, completely assured at Miramar. <br>
          <br>
          *Miramar can accommodate up to 12 guests ONLY if 11th & 12th guests are children under 12 years old sleeping in one of the queen beds in the 3rd bedroom. <br>
          <br>
          "Where can we go snorkeling while staying at Miramar?" You can take a short walk or drive down the hill to Solitude beach. The snorkeling is nice around the point that Miramar is located on. There is also a small sunken sail boat that can be explored. If you want pristine snorkeling, Jack and Isaacs Bay, a National Park, is about a 10-minute drive to the east and a 5-minute hike to the cove. And driving west, about 10 minutes from Miramar, you can snorkel at Shoys Bay or at the neighboring resort, The Buccaneer, which has a restaurant, bar and beach chairs. Of course, Buck Island, a U.S. National Underwater Monument, a one and a half mile-short boat ride opposite Miramar, offers underwater trails and is a top 10 beach and snorkeling destination in the Caribbean. </p>
