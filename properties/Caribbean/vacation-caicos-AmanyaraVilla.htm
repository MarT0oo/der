          <h1 align="left">Amanyara Villa, Wheeland, Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Vacation Rental</h1>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Amanyara Villa is a unique property even within the bounds of this rarefied Turks and Caicos resort. A pavilion-style compound, the Villa fronts the longest stretch of pristine beach at this exquisite resort and offers design and amenities found only here.<br />
            <br />
            Modeled after the resort itself, the six bedrooms, great room, kitchen, den, gym, and beach sala are all connected by meandering paths and various bodies of water. Tranquil black ponds cut through the southern side of the property; a chic, volcanic rock infinity-edged pool stretches in front of the great room; and translucent Caribbean water laps the beach just steps from the sala Designed by world-renowned architect Jean-Michel Gathy, the Villa’s central structure is the great room— the congregating point for family dinners and inside lounging. Beneath the double-height ceiling sits a dining table for 12 and an expansive living area all carefully curated by famed French interior designer Tino Zervudachi. The exquisitely rendered interiors include the work of contemporary furniture icons such as Christian Astuguevieille and Sergio Rodrigues, and wonderfully mix organic woods, handcrafted Tibetan rugs and African inspired fabrics.<br />
            <br />
            Honoring what is essential to the islands, the Villa’s design maintains a palette of warm woods, crisp whites, and watery blues, extending the environment’s perfection into the deceptively simple interiors. There is a particular opulence to the property, not of gold leaf and marble, but of air, water, space, and time.<br />
            <br />
            The bedroom suites—six in total under 4 roofs— feature panoramic windows that allow for a virtually unmitigated connection to nature. The pavilion design allows for privacy however still encourages family time and shared experiences. Each suite offers something slightly different, but the similarities outweigh the differences. Clean-lined modern Flexform sofas are paired with articulate lighting by Artemide, and platform beds anchor open floor plan rooms. There is the sense that everything superfluous has been removed and what remains is exactly what you need—just the luxury of the natural environment.<br />
            <br />
            The oceanside suites offer master showers with un- obstructed sky views courtesy of floor-to-ceiling glass doors that open to secondary outdoor shower and tub gardens. And from the grand master, the bathing garden intuitively leads to a discrete path direct to the gym and Pilates studio. This suite offers the unique privilege of an ocean view the moment you open your eyes.<br />
            <br />
            The lakeside suite sits facing the serene black lake, artfully designed with the simplicity of a Japanese garden. This suite like its ocean counterparts has an extended living area and an oversized soaking tub set in the expansive bath area behind the bed. Across the lake, the three-bedroom, three-bath pavilion has twin or king bed options and en suite baths, one with a freestanding tub. All bedrooms in this wing are wisely accessible through exterior doors, as well as connected through internal hallways, allowing for both privacy and for family members to sleep under one roof. A private breakfast garden is tucked beside the pavilion between the lake and the dense native vegetation<br />
            <br />
            The den, situated on the lakeside of the property, is surrounded by lush landscaping and enjoys extended eaves creating a cool shaded respite from the otherwise sun-drenched property. Here, movies can be watched with the 3D Blueray player on the huge HD TV or you can simply lounge, reading on the oversized sofa.<br />
            <br />
            From the living room veranda the soft chirp of local wildlife and the rhythmic lapping of waves accompanies a languid afternoon. The gorgeously long infinity pool stretches before you, surrounded by perfectly manicured grass, while steps away Amanyara’s beach awaits, perhaps the world’s finest. Powder-fine white sand melts into crystal clear water so perfectly translucent you can see the ocean floor as you swim. While the design and location alone make the Amanyara Villa a truly unique property, it is service that has always distinguished Amanresorts. Here, the Villa is serviced by dedicated hosts—3 on a 24hr-rotating schedule—who are invisible yet ever-present, seeming to anticipate your needs before you voice them.<br />
            <br />
            In advance of your arrival, staff will stock the pantry with your requested items and prepare a weekly menu based on your tastes and specific preferences. Dinners, often organized around regional cuisine, range from Thai curries to Asian BBQ to Mediterranean. If you’ve spent the afternoon fishing you can request that the chef include your catch into the menu for a truly unique meal.<br />
            <br />
            The great room dining area is the usual setting for the evening meal, but staff can arrange a beach dinner in front of the villa, or an after dinner bonfire with s’mores for an evening treat. Private dining from the restaurant is always an option as well.<br />
            <br />
            Along with your Villa hosts, your Villa chef is available for anything you can imagine from an early morning green juice to late night Parmesan popcorn.<br />
            <br />
            If you choose to leave your sanctuary and head down to the Restaurant, local live music plays regularly. And if you’re looking to leave the Villa for a quiet dinner for two, a few options for private dining exist including the Ocean Cove and Ocean Edge. These two isolated beachside spots replete with a dedicated server and a bespoke tasting menu are available by special request.<br />
            <br />
            At the Bar, the properties tallest and most recognizable structure, a mixologist stands at the ready for island- inspired cocktails like the must-try Amanyara Cooler and a Sommelier is on hand for wine recommendations. Here, facing west across the infinity-edge lap pool is the island’s best place to watch the sun dip into the glass- clear water. While staff is always prepared to cater lunch, for a change of scenery or a bit of people watching, the Beach Club restaurant is only a five-minute walk down the beach and an equally good place to stop for a cool cocktail after a long beach walk.<br />
            <br />
            Amid this 18,000 acre nature preserve, the resort offers countless ways to enjoy the turquoise waters. Hobie Cats, ocean kayaks, paddle boards and snorkeling gear are at your disposal and world-renowned diving is located directly in front of the resort. A mere 500 meters from the beach lie the remarkable coral reef walls of  the Northwest Point Marine National Park. This eight- kilometer fringing reef system that runs parallel to the coastline is dominated by boulder star coral, elkhorn coral and Gorgonians of various species that are home to schooling fish, turtles, spotted eagle rays and a multitude of other sea life.<br />
            <br />
            On land you can take advantage of the tennis program created by Peter Rennert and enjoy one of the four professional grade tennis courts either making use of an instructor or hitter, or simply playing with family or friends. To improve the skills of younger members of your household, a half court is available ensuring that good tennis habits are acquired early. All equipment from racquets to tennis shoes are available upon request.<br />
            <br />
            To explore the sprawling resort at large, the Villa offers bicycles and solar powered buggies for your exclusive use.<br />
            <br />
            Complementary yoga classes are offered at the spa each morning, but private sessions at the Villa are available by arrangement. Almost all spa services available at the spa can be enjoyed at the Villa.
            
            The Villa has a private gym replete with a professional grade Pilates machine, a spin bike, weights, exercise balls and yoga mats. The Pilates program has been designed by the noted New York instructor Erika Bloom.<br />
            <br />
            For those wanting to hit the links, Provo Golf Club is a 30-minute drive into town. The 18-hole championship course is consistently voted within the top ten Caribbean golf courses. The course offers four sets of tees for all golfing levels, premium TaylorMade golf clubs for rental, a full-service pro shop, and practice chipping and putting areas.<br />
            <br />
            If you’re interested in discovering the island beyond Amanyara, a chauffeured Land Rover can take you into town for a bit of shopping or an evening meal<br />
