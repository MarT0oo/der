          The island of Saint-Barthelemy is situated at Latitude 17.55° north and Longitude 62.50° West just above the Tropic of Cancer in the extreme north-east of the Caribbean Sea. It is 6000 km (3750 miles) from Paris, 2500 km (1550 miles) from New York and 180 km (100 miles) from Puerto Rico. <br>
          <br>
          Saint-Barthelemy is part of the Leeward Isles or Lesser Antilles. It is situated between the Islands of St Martin and St Kitts and Nevis in the South-West and the Islands of Antigua and Barbuda in the South-East. It is 25 km (15 miles) South-East of Saint Martin and 230 km (126 miles) North-West of Guadeloupe. <br>
          <br>
          Saint-Barthelemy is in fact an archipelago as it is surrounded by a number of small islands; Chevreau, Coco, Fourchue, Frégate, Tortue, Le Boulanger, Les Grenadins, Pain de Sucre, Petit Jean and Toc Vert. <br>
          <br>
          Nestled between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean in the north of the West Indies, the island has preserved the charm of its wilderness and its precious environment.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Activities</strong><br>
          <br>
          The beaches and all they offer are not the only things to be appreciated on the island. You will find on Saint-Barthelemy a large choice of sporting and outdoor activities.
          Have confidence in our qualified professionals who can advice you on what is available and where.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Diving</strong><br>
          <br>
          Whether you use snorkeling equipment or you dive with bottles you will be enchanted by this rich and wonderful marine world  You will discover in the not very deep waters, the magnificent coral reefs, the multitude of multi-coloured fishes and turtles (which have been illegal to fish since 1991).<br>
          <br>
          Each beach has its coral reef; each small island has it rocks and grottos. The best diving is to be found around Pain du Sucre just out side the port of Gustavia, around the point at l’Ane Rouge in Colombier and around the Isle of Coco. Just outside the harbor in 1991 a ship sunk and you can have fabulous dive around this wreck at a depth of 75 meters.<br>
          <br>
          Every person who dives in the protected marine reserves must pay 1 euro per dive. The funds raised go to help to maintain the moorings made available for boats wishing to visit the reserves.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Surfing and Windsurfing</strong><br>
          <br>
          St Jean and Grand Cul-de-Sac are best for Windsurfing whilst Anse des Cayes and Lorient are more frequented by surfers. Windsurfing boards and catamarans can be hired on the beach at St Jean.  As a novice or at competition level, specialist schools and shops will advise you in either of these water sports.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Yachts and Sailing</strong><br>
          <br>
          To relax and get away into the calm, turquoise waters or race, hiring a boat will help you discover Saint-Barthelemy from another angle, that of the sea with its steep cliffs, large bays and sandy beaches. <br>
          <br>
          For a day, half a day or a sunset cruise, several boat hiring agencies propose relaxing outings with a crew or without, for the more experienced, either around Saint-Barthelemy or a trip to one of the islands near Saint-Barthelemy; St Martin, Anguilla, Fourchue or Tintamarie. Take your snorkelling equipment and swim amongst the thousands of fish of all varieties and colours. Be tempted by a real Planters Punch and a wonderful meal followed by the legendary afternoon siesta under the tropical sun.<br>
          <br>
          You could also take a 3 day trip, even a week or more, with a crew and visit the other islands. <br>
          <br>
          Small sporting catamarans, principally the “Hobbycat” type of 13 to 20 feet, are available in St Jean for an initiation course with a professional or to navigate alone or with a small group. The sailing school situated in Public offers several types of boats for hire. They also organise boat races at all levels all year long. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Fishing</strong><br>
          <br>
          For several years the reputation of Saint-Barthelemy as a top deep sea fishing rendezvous has been confirmed again and again. Tuna and Wahoo fishing are proposed by several companies with half or full day trips and all the equipment necessary supplied. </p>
