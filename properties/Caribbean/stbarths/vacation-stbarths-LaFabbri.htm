          <h1 align="left">La Fabbri, Lorient, St. Barts, Caribbean Vacation Rental</h1>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">There are places you don’t happen upon just by chance. Undreamt of places, concealed somewhere at the other end of the world. Places whose secrecy alone justifies the journey, where warm and welcoming serenity, appreciable discretion and endless sunshine make crossing the ocean worthwhile. Neither hotels nor guest houses, these addresses cultivate the mystery of a full-fledged lifestyle that is yours for the taking.      
            La Fabbri is one such secluded spot. Hidden in the heart of the Caribbean on the Island of Saint Barth and just a few meters away from the Lorient beach, this hotel has a legendary past peopled with stars who, for a long time, were faithful visitors to the most Parisian nightclub in the French West Indies.  No point in giving their names. Insiders know them off by heart and only like to reminisce amongst themselves. <br />
            <br />
            Is this perhaps the reason why La Fabbri has been able to come back to life again?  Like a Phoenix, a little shy about being too well known and once the hotspot for wild parties thrown by the entertainment world legend Jean Marie Rivière, the hotel has now reinvented itself.  Here, time is no longer what we are usually accustomed to.  Somewhere between its past heritage and dynamic present, La Fabbri likes to mix the genres, merge eras, styles and personalities. The furniture designed by Pierre Jeanneret for the city of Chandigarh, the pieces signed by Charlotte Perriand and Jean Royère or Serge Mouille make each space – bedroom, bar or suite – as stylish as it is cozy.<br />
            <br />
            Lulled by the balmy breezes whispering in the palm trees and latania and flooded under a torrent of blossoming hibiscus, the garden is transformed into a luxuriant hideaway, highlighted by the frescos of Cyprien Chabert. The walls like blank pages on which everyone can write their own story, their own dreams and desires, are today immaculately white. <br />
            <br />
            Whether it’s about the past, the present or a story to be told, La Fabbri is entirely devoted to a handful of privileged people. Relying as much on secrecy as on generosity, it proposes  its nine bedrooms ranging in size from 30 to 45 m2, its bathrooms opening onto a private patio, its swimming pool and its subdued luxury to demanding connoisseurs for whom good taste and the cult of privacy are genuine values to be safeguarded. <br />
            <br />
            So come. Discover and enjoy. Sheltered from view, proud of its legendary past yet enamoured of modernity, henceforth La Fabbri is somewhere that can be yours and yours alone. Far from the world’s hustle and bustle, this is the place to settle in comfortably and relax. Feel at home while surrendering yourself to the caressing breezes and melodious song of the birds of paradise.  Because this is what life is like at La Fabbri. And it’s all yours to appreciate. <br />

            Greeting upon arrival :<br />
            <br />
            La Fabbri maintains a complimentary greeting and welcome at the St Barts' airport. The client, is escorted to his car and then to his villa, which has been verified by Housekeeping and Maintenance as ready to accept new guests. The client is then briefed as to how the villa works : where the electrical box is in case of an emergency ; how the oven, air conditioning, television and VCR work ; and generally how the villa functions in order that it is enjoyed properly, as the owner wishes. There is a manual in the villa for the renter, explaining the operation of the villa. An Arrival Envelope is provided which includes a greeting letter, maps, brochures and island information, as well as emergency telephone numbers, so that the client is quickly familiarized with the island. On the day of departure our aiport team is here any time to help you on your way back and assist you at the airport for boarding. </p><br>
          <br>
          <strong>Activities</strong><br>
          <br>
          The beaches and all they offer are not the only things to be appreciated on the island. You will find on Saint-Barthelemy a large choice of sporting and outdoor activities.
          Have confidence in our qualified professionals who can advice you on what is available and where.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Diving</strong><br>
          <br>
          Whether you use snorkeling equipment or you dive with bottles you will be enchanted by this rich and wonderful marine world  You will discover in the not very deep waters, the magnificent coral reefs, the multitude of multi-coloured fishes and turtles (which have been illegal to fish since 1991).<br>
          <br>
          Each beach has its coral reef; each small island has it rocks and grottos. The best diving is to be found around Pain du Sucre just out side the port of Gustavia, around the point at l’Ane Rouge in Colombier and around the Isle of Coco. Just outside the harbor in 1991 a ship sunk and you can have fabulous dive around this wreck at a depth of 75 meters.<br>
          <br>
          Every person who dives in the protected marine reserves must pay 1 euro per dive. The funds raised go to help to maintain the moorings made available for boats wishing to visit the reserves.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Surfing and Windsurfing</strong><br>
          <br>
          St Jean and Grand Cul-de-Sac are best for Windsurfing whilst Anse des Cayes and Lorient are more frequented by surfers. Windsurfing boards and catamarans can be hired on the beach at St Jean.  As a novice or at competition level, specialist schools and shops will advise you in either of these water sports.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Yachts and Sailing</strong><br>
          <br>
          To relax and get away into the calm, turquoise waters or race, hiring a boat will help you discover Saint-Barthelemy from another angle, that of the sea with its steep cliffs, large bays and sandy beaches. <br>
          <br>
          For a day, half a day or a sunset cruise, several boat hiring agencies propose relaxing outings with a crew or without, for the more experienced, either around Saint-Barthelemy or a trip to one of the islands near Saint-Barthelemy; St Martin, Anguilla, Fourchue or Tintamarie. Take your snorkelling equipment and swim amongst the thousands of fish of all varieties and colours. Be tempted by a real Planters Punch and a wonderful meal followed by the legendary afternoon siesta under the tropical sun.<br>
          <br>
          You could also take a 3 day trip, even a week or more, with a crew and visit the other islands. <br>
          <br>
          Small sporting catamarans, principally the “Hobbycat” type of 13 to 20 feet, are available in St Jean for an initiation course with a professional or to navigate alone or with a small group. The sailing school situated in Public offers several types of boats for hire. They also organise boat races at all levels all year long. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Fishing</strong><br>
          <br>
          For several years the reputation of Saint-Barthelemy as a top deep sea fishing rendezvous has been confirmed again and again. Tuna and Wahoo fishing are proposed by several companies with half or full day trips and all the equipment necessary supplied. </p>
