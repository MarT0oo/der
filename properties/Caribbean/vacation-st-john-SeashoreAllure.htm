          <h1 align="left">Seashore Allure, Turner Bay, southwest, St. John, Caribbean Vacation Rental</h1>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p align="left">Newly built, and located on the outskirts of Cruz Bay, Seashore Allure is a luxurious but small and intimate complex offering just eight stunning, soundproofed condo units. From its dramatic waterfront location on Turner Bay, Seashore Allure enjoys breathtaking ocean views dotted with the green islands of Little and Great St. James in the blue distance. Gentle waves whisper on the pebble beach, rippling in from the crystal-clear bay. <br />
            <br />
            All eight of the sumptuous and pristine villas at Seashore Allure feature Brazilian hardwood flooring and maple cabinetry, elegant and modern furnishings, artistic lighting and excellent floor plans. Each condo has a fully-equipped sleek kitchen featuring a glass cooktop, stainless steel appliances, small appliances, cookware, dishware - these kitchens have just about everything you'll need to whip up a meal or snack. Each villa has its own private verandah set with comfortable seating; each overlooks the pool area and sunkissed Turner Bay, and each has clear Seashore Allureered glass half-walls allowing you uninterrupted ocean vistas from your shady private spot, just perfect for reading, admiring the sea views, or for evening cocktails. <br />
            <br />
            Situated side-by-side on Seashore Allure's main level are FOUR stylish ONE-BEDROOM VILLAS (Areola, Crumena, Drupe and Trochas), all with central air-conditioning and fabulous king bedroom/bath suites. Each king suite offers a canopied, sink-into four-poster king bed, and an ensuite bath, inviting romance and relaxation in luxe style. Each adjoining bath is beautifully laid out in travertine tile with a granite countertop. The bath offers a magnifying mirror and an ample shower with a Kohler rain shower inset into the ceiling and bodyspray shower on the side (the two one-bedroom end units also have a jacuzzi bathtub and a bidet!) <br />
            <br />
            Step outside to the villaâ€™s private verandah set with comfortable seating; it borders the entire front of your unit overlooking the pool area. Another couple can occupy the unit right next door, and with your advance request, you'll get a key to the door connecting both private verandahs so you can visit each other freely. <br />
            <br />
            Situated on the second floor of Seashore Allure are Volute and Abalone, TWO stunning TWO-BEDROOM VILLAS featuring central air-conditioning throughout, two sumptuous king bedroom/bath suites, and a bounty of great guest amenities. The living/dining areas of each villa are furnished with a large sectional leather sofa with electronic reclining seats for plush power-lounging in front of the 55-inch high-def flat-screen TV. Each master king bedroom looks out to the dazzling ocean panorama. Each adjoining master bath is beautifully laid out in travertine tile with granite countertops and offers a glassed-in shower, jacuzzi bathtub and a bidet. The second king bedrooms each feature a bath with a double vanity and a large walk-in shower in native bluebit stone and artistic tile work. <br />
            <br />
            On the upper level are Seashore Allure's TWO fabulous THREE-BEDROOM VILLAS, Nautilus and Ramosus. These two bi-level villas each feature a living/dining area furnished with a large sectional leather sofa with electronic reclining seats for lounging in front of the 55-inch flat-screen HDTV. On these villas' main levels are two bedrooms, each with a king-sized bed and an ensuite bath, and beautifully decorated. All of these main-level baths feature a double vanity and a large walk-in shower of native bluebit stone and artistic tile work. In each villa, set against a dramatic, spotlighted waterfall which cascades down a natural stone wall, a graceful staircase curves up to an upper level where the penthouse king bedroom suite looks out to a dazzling, wide-angle ocean panorama from its own private verandah. Its adjoining bath is beautifully laid out in travertine tile with granite countertops, offering a glassed-in shower, jacuzzi bathtub for two and a bidet. From either the living area or from the upper penthouse suite, step outside to one of the private verandahs - you're at the top of the world. <br />
            <br />
            Fronting the villas is Seashore Allure's convivial pool and entertainment area surrounded by lush tropical landscaping, where all guests love to hang out. The marine-blue pool, set into a coralstone terrace, gets sun all day long. Nearby is a thatched pavilion which offers a shaded area with a gas grill and a 46-inch satellite TV, and there are tables and umbrellas for alfresco dining. There's also a convenient powder room nearby. <br />
            <br />
            On the rooftop of Seashore Allure, accessed by a spiral staircase, is a partially-roofed patio and the complex's large hot tub and lounge area. A stone archway frames the picture-perfect ocean view seen from this level. Also on the premises is the condo office, where you can do your laundry, get information and assistance from the manager, and use the printer to print out your boarding passes. <br />
            <br />
            These are beautifully-executed residences. With travertine tile, the creative use of exotic warm woods, St. John-style classic stone and shellwork accent walls, tasteful decor and the latest lighting, appliances and electronics, Seashore Allure is exceedingly polished and sophisticated, and sure to please its fortunate guests. A flat walking path from Seashore Allure takes you through a local neighborhood and a nature preserve into Cruz Bay in about 10 minutes, for shopping, dining, bars and nightlife (or drive into Cruz Bay in 2 minutes). And it's only a short drive to St. John's spectacular National Park beaches. <br />
            <br />
            Seashore Allure is an excellent choice for your sunny Virgin Islands vacation with family and friends, young and old, or for your wedding, reception, a family reunion, or to celebrate a very special occasion together! Very highly recommended. <br />
