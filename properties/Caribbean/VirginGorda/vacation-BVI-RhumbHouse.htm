        <h1 align="left">Rhumb House, Tortola, British Virgin Islands, Caribbean Vacation Rental</h1>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Conveniently located just a 10-minute drive to Road Town to the west, and a 10-minute drive to the airport to the east, Rhumb House sits atop a scenic promontory on almost two acres, a private estate commanding spellbinding views of Paraquita and Brandywine Bays and yachts sailing through Sir Francis Drake Channel. This impressive enclave is tucked behind a gate. A cobblestone driveway leads to Rhumb House's dramatic entrance graced by a colonnade of towering royal palms, a fanciful filigreed gazebo and a flagstone walkway that threads through tropical gardens and koi ponds and looks over 180-degree views of the Caribbean Sea dotted with green islets and cays beyond. <br>
          <br>
          Double doors open into a large, airy foyer with a lush atrium garden of torch ginger and ferns. An inviting sitting area faces the ocean, with french doors accessing the terrace, outdoor dining area and pool just outside. The foyer area also has a powder room done in Caribbean blue. To the left is the estate's air-conditioned drawing room, where an eclectic mix of antiques and contemporary furnishings combine serene elegance and comfort, and where the spectacular ocean view fills arched windows above cushioned window seats. <br>
          <br>
          The formal dining room is just steps away. An impressive dome set into the ceiling and inlaid with exotic woods canopies the grand Regency-style dining table, an objet dâ€™art itself with wood inlays, brass stringing and quatrefoils, seating up to 16. Large windowed doors open out to terraces, a reflecting pool and gardens on three sides, and a planter of palms with a skylight above borders the fourth side of this handsome room. Adjacent are the kitchen, modest but efficiently laid out and well-equipped with a large Sub-Zero fridge, double ovens and more. <br>
          <br>
          Off the main entry room on the other side of the atrium is Rhumb House's air-conditioned Bedroom/bath 1, a suite where you may choose to have made up either a king bed or two twins. The spacious ensuite bath is whimsically tiled in green and blue, including the walk-in sunken shower which looks out on gardens through a sunny arched window. <br>
          <br>
          Air-conditioned Bedroom/bath 2 is next door, accessed by one of Rhumb House's exotic features - pathways of large flat stepping stones which span a shallow koi pond dotted with water lilies and plants and pergola overhead. Bedroom suite 2 offers a comfortable private sitting area, a bamboo king half-poster bed, a colorful and large fully-tiled bath, a connecting door to Bedroom 1 (perfect for parents with children), and it shares a breezy terrace with Bedroom 1. <br>
          <br>
          The lily pond's stepping stones lead on past a lion's head fountain to Rhumb House's air-conditioned office and well-stocked library, where two desks under windows let you enjoy the sublime vistas if you have to work a bit on vacation. A four-in-one printer is there for your use. <br>
          <br>
          The lily pond's stone bridge leads off to a hallway and to the charming living room artfully adorned with hand painted shutters and whimsical sink-into sofas and chairs dressed in relaxing pastel colors. This room is the spot for gathering to watch TV and DVD movies. <br>
          <br>
          Beyond is Bedroom 3, an air-conditioned king suite with a four-poster tester bed and its own balcony overlooking the pool terrace and the blue expanse of Sir Francis Drake Channel. The adjoining bath is spacious, completely tiled in a tropical theme of aqua, pink and yellow. <br>
          <br>
          Across the hall is air-conditioned Bedroom 4, a lovely bamboo four-poster king suite with an ensuite bath done in a captivating yellow, lavender and aqua tile design. <br>
          <br>
          Bedroom 5, an air-conditioned king suite with its own balcony, overlooks the pool terrace and Brandywine Bay. Its roomy adjoining bath is completely tiled in a tropical theme of turquoise, lavender and yellow. <br>
          <br>
          Across more stepping stones, the king Master Suite is so elegantly furnished in lavender and white, with a cool marble floor and an expansive adjoining tiled bath, also with a marble floor, a double vanity, a dressing area, bidet and two showers which look out to the sea views. Also air-conditioned, the lovely and private Master Suite opens directly via french doors to the pool terrace, but also has its own private terrace. Electronic shutters can be raised or lowered in this suite to regulate light coming in the windows. <br>
          <br>
          From the main corridor, an exterior staircase curves down to the Game Room, a breezeway with a full-sized pool table and just outside, a patio and a graveled bocce ball court. The laundry room is also located on this level. <br>
          <br>
          Rhumb House is a gracious estate, completely private, as there is no public road through it, beautifully landscaped and well laid out in its secluded and dramatic setting. Blue ocean views below blue Caribbean skies are always mesmerizing, and sunset skies can be spectacular from the terrace. Furnishings and Rhumb House's fine detailing are unique and charming. There's lots of room and privacy for everyone here, and generous areas for everyone to gather together...Rhumb House is the perfect villa for extended families and groups of friends who want to enjoy the island life in style and elegance. 
          <br><br>
          There is a small guest cottage located east, below the villa's parking area, occupied by an elderly gentlewoman named Pearl. Peal has lived at Rhumb House for almost 30 years. She is available should you have questions or an emergency, but of course, your privacy at Rhumb House is completely assured
