        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">A Private Sanctuary Awaits You. Built in the 1880s, The Annandale homestead has been lovingly restored to create a luxurious five-bedroom villa, in a private and tranquil setting, providing guests with one of New Zealand's foremost Owners Cottage accommodation options. <br />
          <br />
          Enjoy the casual elegance of a bygone era. Built in the 1880s, the Annandale homestead has been lovingly restored to create a luxurious five-bedroom home in a private and tranquil setting. Comfortable rooms, shaded verandahs, vast gardens and exclusive use of our outdoor leisure facilities make the house a great place to make your own for relaxation and exploration. <br />
          <br />
          We want you to feel the strong sense of belonging that Annandale evokes, so we encourage you to make it your home for the duration of your stay. You won’t find any Keep Out signs here… you are welcome to roam and explore at will: cut a few flowers from the borders and some salad leaves from the kitchen garden, grab some lemons for your crepes from one of our trees. It’s all yours and yours alone. <br />
          <br />
          The homestead’s four spacious master suites and playful bunk room are all beautifully appointed and thoughtfully furnished with the crispest of linens, comfortable reading nooks and adjustable lighting. <br />
          <br />
          All suites have en suite bathrooms, thermostatic controllers and plenty of storage space. Three of the master suites have king-size beds and verandahs. The fourth master suite can be set up with a king-size bed or with twin singles. The fifth bedroom is all about fun: sleeping a maximum of six people, it has a set of bunks as well as two double beds, plus a surprise that will delight visitors both old and young – a secret staircase that leads down to the kitchen via the butler’s pantry. If your party requires extra accommodation, it is possible to book The Stables in conjunction with the homestead. This self-contained and spacious loft apartment sleeps up to four. <br />
          <br />
          Opposite the homestead is Annandale’s original stables, where the rich aroma of leather and hay that has permeated the aged timbers of the ground floor belies the presence of a spacious two-bedroom luxury loft upstairs. The furniture and decor of this self-contained accommodation complement the history and character of the building, while allowing you to relax in warm and contemporary comfort.  Only available to parties staying at Annandale Homestead, The Stables offers a perfect blend of privacy and proximity for up to four guests. <br />
          <br />
          The heart of the Annandale homestead is undoubtedly the large kitchen, with its farmhouse table and views out to the lawns and kitchen garden beyond. Fully stocked with delicious breakfast provisions and pantry supplies, plus all the appliances, kitchenware and utensils you might need, we intend to make you feel right at home. <br />
          <br />
          The kitchen leads through to the warm and spacious drawing room and library, where you can choose to get cosy in front of the fire or enjoy the views through the French doors to the gardens and the bay glinting through the trees. The elegant dining room seats 12 and features original kauri furniture, which has witnessed many lively dinners through the years. <br />
          <br />
          Our state-of-the-art recreation facilities include an outdoor 20-metre heated swimming pool with lighting system, 40-degree spa pool, flood-lit tennis court and top-of-the-line gym equipment including treadmill, weights, exercycle and elliptical, and all-weather changing rooms <br>
          Cooking Classes <br>
          <br>
          If you wish to spend some of your time at Annandale improving your kitchen skills or finding out more about New Zealand cuisine, take advantage of a cooking class with our on-site chef. Without even having to leave the property, you can specify what you’d like to learn about and spend a wonderful day transforming fresh produce into delicious dishes with the help of a professional. Alternatively, for an off-site experience, nearby Akaroa has its own cooking school, offering popular themed courses during which a guest chef inspires his or her students with fresh, local ingredients and expert techniques. Contact us to find out more about these tantalising options. <br>
          <br>
          Scenic Tours <br>
          <br>
          There are lots of ways to discover Annandale and the surrounding region, and plenty of friendly local guides ready to ensure you get the highlights, no matter how short your stay. Take to the skies in a helicopter for a bird’s eye perspective of the dramatic landscape, for example, or let a local fishing expert take you out in a boat or to one of the nearby rivers. We would be happy to tailor an experience just for you, or you are welcome to contact a local tour operator to discuss your requirements. <br>
          <br>
          Farm Activities <br>
          <br>
          Just as the tide ebbs and flows, the seasons and colours of the 4,000-acre Annandale farm change throughout year, from luscious greens in spring to tussocky golds by autumn, and we encourage guests to explore and be as hands-on as they like <br />
