          <h1 align="left">Baan Jasmine, Samui Beach Village, Koh Samui, Thailand Vacation Rental</h1>
          <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Baan Jasmine Luxury Villa is an ultra modern, luxurious holiday accommodation in Koh Samui with its own substantial private pool set in lush tropical gardens. <br />
            <br />
            It is the perfect location to enjoy the tranquil beaches that make up the south-east corner of Koh Samui, washed by the calm waters of the Gulf of Siam. It forms part of Samui Beach Village, a new exclusive beachside development. <br />
            <br />
            Baan Jasmine Koh Samui luxury villa offers all that could be desired for a perfect holiday: from accommodation that epitomises the grace of Thai architecture and characteristic luxurious furnishings to the ever attentive service provided by our experienced staff. <br />
            <br />
            It is just 30 minutes from the picturesque airport of Koh Samui. On arrival you will be met by our driver will who will bring you to your luxury villa, where you will be greeted by our manageress, Fiona, and her staff. Throughout your stay they will be at your service, with just one aim: to ensure you have a relaxing and memorable holiday. <br />
            <br />
            Only a 30 second walk to a beautiful stretch of beach, Baan Jasmine is one of Samui Beach Village's large luxury villas, catering for parties up to nine people - typically six adults plus children. It has a spacious integral lounge and dining room, together with a fully furnished kitchen, all with modern conveniences such as a roomy American style fridge and dishwasher. The three large bedrooms including the guest room in its own villa are all fitted with en-suite bathrooms (a fourth bathroom is located perfectly for easy pool access), walk-in dressing rooms and terraces and situated in spacious tropical gardens with your own private swimming pool, sundeck, sala, outdoor kitchen and barbecue. <br />
            <br />
            The luxury Samui villa features a beautiful decor and traditional artifacts from around Thailand. Its very spacious rooms have been designed with your personal comfort in mind, with air conditioning appropriate to the sunny tropical climate complimented by stylish ceiling fans, and with all the windows interchangable between glass and mosquito netting to create an ideal ambience at all times. The villa is also equipped with the latest in modern technology including wireless internet and DVD/CD players. <br />
            <br />
            The heart of this luxury villa is the large lounge and living area with TV entertainment system, dining room and gourmet kitchen. As an additional service we can provide you with your own chef, Khun Eak, who will prepare and serve your own choice of both International and Thai cuisine. <br />
            <br />
            From the main living area, large patio doors lead to the poolside terrace and a long modern pool that is ideal both for swimming and as a play pool for children. On either side terraces and sundecks tempt you with sun loungers and parasols, perfect for relaxing under the tropical sun. <br />
            <br />
            There is also a Thai style sala where you can rest in the shade, as well as an outdoor kitchen and barbecue. The lush gardens are full of beautiful tropical plants and trees, visited regularly by a multitude of songbirds and butterflies. <br />
            <br />
            The front gardens have an ornate entrance sala taking you to a sandy path leading directly to the beautiful beaches that are among the most picturesque on the island of Koh Samui. <br />
            <br />
            The stretch of white sand, dotted with children's play pools, is just 30 meters from Baan Jasmine Luxury Villa, and offers magnificent views to the north and south of Samui. Far removed from the busy Samui tourist areas, the beaches are always quiet, only visited by occasional tourists and a few fishermen. During the winter months the beaches and shallow sandy lagoon become an ideal location for kite-boarding. <br />
            <br />
            Master bedroom - 1st Floor. A beautiful king-size bed with natural furnishings overlooks the gardens to the front of the villa.<br />
            There is a large terrace at the front as well as a sun-terrace to the rear with views over the beach and ocean.<br />
            The accommodation also includes a large walk-in dressing room with built-in wardrobes and a large ensuite bathroom with bath and shower. <br />
            <br />
            2nd Bedroom - 1st Floor. Situated opposite the master bedroom, this room has two single beds that can also be made into one single queen sized bed. It also has a front terrace and sun-terrace to the rear, and ensuite dressing room and bathroom as with the master bedroom. <br />
            <br />
            Guest villa. This accommodation offers a separate Luxury Villa within the grounds with its own facilities, ideal for parents, older children or another family party. This facility consists of a large bedroom with king-size bed with its own terrace to the pool. It also has a walk-in dressing room and en-suite bathroom. <br />
            <br />
            All the bedrooms are large and spacious and can accommodate two persons, with the option of a third person/child in a daybed or baby cot. They all have air-conditioning, central ceiling fans and ambient lighting that can be individually adjusted to suit your needs and create the perfect mood. <br><br>Samui Beach Village also offers a unique hotel-style service for our guests. A team of 40 staff is on hand to provide the top quality service you would expect to find in a luxury 5 star resort. Unlike most villa rentals where the service is limited, we pride ourselves on giving our guests the best holiday experience possible. Samui Beach Village is a superb location for people looking to lose themselves in the beauty of Koh Samui's gorgeous beaches and lush tropical landscape. The village - which is set right by the beachside - is a small luxury living development close to the main tourist areas of Samui.<br><br>It adjoins an unspoiled stretch of sandy beach in the relatively undeveloped south-eastern coast, and has been built amid a profusion of coconut palms and tropical landscaped gardens. Two neighbouring islands - Koh Tan and Koh Mudsum - well-known for their fantastic fishing and snorkeling, are only a short, 20-minute boat ride away.<br><br>It is only ten minutes from Lamai Beach, 30 minutes from Chaweng and Samui's top golf course, and 35 minutes from the airport, so you are never far from the action. But while there is easy access to shopping, restaurants, nightlife and other activities, back in Samui Beach Village you will feel you are on your own tropical island paradise.</p>
