Samui Beach Village is a superb location for people looking to lose themselves in the beauty of Koh Samui's gorgeous beaches and lush tropical landscape. The village - which is set right by the beachside - is a small luxury living development close to the main tourist areas of Samui.<br><br>It adjoins an unspoiled stretch of sandy beach in the relatively undeveloped south-eastern coast, and has been built amid a profusion of coconut palms and tropical landscaped gardens. Two neighbouring islands - Koh Tan and Koh Mudsum - well-known for their fantastic fishing and snorkeling, are only a short, 20-minute boat ride away.<br><br>It is only ten minutes from Lamai Beach, 30 minutes from Chaweng and Samui's top golf course, and 35 minutes from the airport, so you are never far from the action. But while there is easy access to shopping, restaurants, nightlife and other activities, back in Samui Beach Village you will feel you are on your own tropical island paradise.</p>
