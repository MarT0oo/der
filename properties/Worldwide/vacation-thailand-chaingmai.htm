        <h1>Chiang Mai Villa, Hills of Angels, Chiang Mai, Thailand Vacation Rental</h1>
        <br>
        <p align="left">Lanna Hill House was designed by one of Thailand’s top architects to reflect the best of both local (Lanna) and colonial design. The result is a beautiful house constructed from only the finest materials, including reclaimed teak throughout. The house is furnished exquisitely with teak, rattan and bamboo furniture. <br>
          <br>
          Perched on a hill overlooking forested mountains, a reservoir and the Mae On valley, the location is blessed with a pleasant climate (up to 7 degrees cooler than central Chiang Mai) and a scattering of small villages untouched by tourism. The house overlooks the 1,800m summit of Doi Mon Larn, one of the highest mountains in Thailand, which also plays host to the famous village of Mae Kampong, a mere 30 minute drive away. The national parks of Takrai and Chae Son are located on the doorstep. The house is managed by Oppy Putman who has helped to transform the beautiful house into a fully serviced villa, offering the best of Thai service, amazing food and a suite of activities that will ensure a unique and authentic experience of Thailand. <br>
          <br>
          The Lanna Hill House concept was inspired by friends and family who often commented on how Thailand was transformed into a magical place when experienced with somebody with genuine local knowledge and a passion for the country. We try to give guests that same experience. <br>
          <br>
          There are 4 double bedrooms, 3 with king size beds and en-suite bathrooms, the other with 2 singles and a cot. Additional single beds can be arranged on request. All bedrooms have air conditioning. The communal areas include living room, play room, great room, library / map room, guest bathroom, kitchen and the ‘crow’s nest’ (perched high in the roof to afford the best views of the lake and mountains. This room can also be used as a bedroom in Winter). <br>
          <br>
          Of course in the semi-tropics you will want to maximise outdoor time. There are 9 covered terraces in total, a courtyard, 2 acres of landscaped gardens and forest which incorporate a small trail and a traditional sala, ideal for yoga and fitness. There are stunning views from nearly every angle of the property. The house is equipped with a 10m salt water swimming pool. A children’s pool is annexed to the main pool and also doubles as a Jacuzzi. The water is sourced from a spring that provides swimmers with a cool dip all year round. Other facilities at the house include a games room, equipped with table tennis and a selection of toys and wooden games, high speed internet and satellite TV. The wireless high speed internet is available at no cost (Last tested download speed 7Mbps). Satellite TV includes a wide selection of channels in the English language including five film channels, BBC and CNN news and up to 10 sport channels. <br>
          <br>
          The house is furnished to a very high standard. All the floors are made from teak, as are the doors and shutters (over 300 hinged units in total!). <br>
          <br>
          Lanna Hill house is serviced by a team of staff recruited locally or from disadvantaged hill tribes. They are fully trained and wear beautiful locally inspired uniforms. All staff are paid a fair wage, above the market rate. They also partake in a profit sharing scheme, which allows them to benefit from all food and beverage sales. Read more about our services. <br>
          <br>
          Lanna Hill House is the ideal location to relax, with the stunning scenery, climate and in house facilities reason enough to stay. However, we would encourage everyone to explore the local region and of course Chiang Mai. This part of Northern Thailand is largely undiscovered with very few foreign tourists. We have commissioned Orient Xplorer to design a number of bespoke tours exclusively for guests staying at our villa. <br>
          <br>
          In addition to our own activities, we can offer advice on tours, shopping, car hire and drivers, and restaurants. Of course the advice is free, but has tremendous value. You will be getting the inside track of what is best to do and see in Chiang Mai. Not what travel agents and guides tell you. This will ensure you get a truly authentic and unique view of Thailand. Read more about activities. <br>
          <br>
          Lanna Hill House recognises that food is a very important element of any travel experience. We are fortunate to have our menu designed by khun Tim, the founder of a famous Thai cookery school who has been a regular feature on TV both in Thailand and abroad. She has developed a delicious menu with a focus on fresh food and local dishes and trained our staff in the preparation of her dishes. <br>
          <br>
          As far as possible we try to source ingredients from the local region or our garden. Our vegetable and spice garden is developing to provide a large proportion of the ingredients required by our menu. Fruits, vegetables and spices grown in the garden include Avocado, mango, tamarind, banana, chillies, ginger, guava, papaya, passion fruit, basil, coriander, spring onions, lemon leaves, lemon grass, limes, Thai aubergine, galanga, cumin, long beans, and various green vegetables. Where ingredients are sourced from town, we try and use the King’s project, Doi Kham, which supports agriculture in the mountains by disadvantaged hill tribe people. They are extremely high quality. <br>
          <br>
          Breakfast comprises a selection of cereals, breads, fresh seasonal fruit, your choice of eggs, juice and coffee / tea. Thai breakfast is available on request. Breakfast is included in the tariff. A light lunch menu offers a choice of Thai dishes, salads and sandwiches. Picnics are also available for those who wish to go exploring in the national parks. <br>
          <br>
          The evening meal comprises a three course Thai dinner, which is prepared according to a set menu although variations are available on request. Dinner preparations commence mid aftennoon by a team of 2 to four local chefs. All sauces and pastes are made from raw ingredients when the meal is being prepared. The focus is on fresh high quality produce. A typical dinner might include a curry , a fish or prawn dish, one or two vegetables dishes and of course Thai fragrant rice. Vegetarian and children’s dishes are available on request. We also encourage guests to cook with our staff if they so wish. <br>
          <br>
          Northern Thailand is famous for its coffee. Cool mountain slopes are the perfect host to Arabica coffee plants and we exclusively stock northern coffee in our house. Both coffee and tea are available at no extra charge to our guests. A choice selection of drinks is available from our “trust bar” or from our catering staff when they are at the house. </p>
