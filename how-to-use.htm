            <div class="usa_font_2 font12 h3" align="justify"></p>
              <p>Welcome to Dreamexoticrentals.com a marketing company for  owners worldwide.&nbsp; We are a By Owner Network, which means we market these  homes for individual owners who cannot market them on their own.&nbsp; We are  not Realtors or Property Managers, but if you need one, we can of course  recommend a few that are in our &ldquo;trusted network.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, you <strong><em><u>DO</u></em></strong><u> <strong><em>NOT PAY MORE</em></strong></u> for using our site, the owners pay us a % of  their rates to us.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Our Site is Extremely Easy to use.&nbsp; Please follow  guidelines below.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>Finding Your Location &nbsp;</strong></p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Please go to the menu on the left hand side of your screen  and find your desired location.&nbsp; If you do not find it right away you may  go to the &ldquo;other section&rdquo; under your desired country.&nbsp; You will find we  have &ldquo;other&rdquo; cities/states being added daily.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>Inquiring </strong></p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Once you make your decision based on one or two of the homes  you like, you can send just one form.&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s right, just one  form.&nbsp; You will only need to send us one form which indicates your area of  interest, the number of guests, dates of travel, and budget.&nbsp; Your budget  is extremely important just in case you cannot go too high or if your budget is  quite high.&nbsp; Every inquiry is unique, we understand that.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>Receiving a Reply</strong></p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Once you fill out the form, our representatives receive  those inquiries in their general mailbox. Each individual inquiry is sent off  to the specialist in that area.&nbsp; The homes with availability within your  pricing guidelines and needs will be sent to you.&nbsp; You will get a link and  or a brochure, with the information on pricing, area, and anything else you may  need to know.&nbsp; Once you find a home you like, just respond.&nbsp; If your  first choices are not exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for, you can either call your  representative back (all contact information is on the email), or you can reply  to the email you receive.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>Once I&rsquo;m Ready to Book</strong> &nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Once you&rsquo;re ready to book everything moves quickly.&nbsp;  Since other inquiries are coming in, the owners do not allow us to place holds  on any properties over 48 hours.&nbsp; So, just because it is available one  day, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s going to be available the next.&nbsp; Holiday Time  Frames and High Season times get booked up fairly quickly.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">You will be sent a form to fill out, which tells the owner  who you are and how many are in your group.&nbsp; Once that is filled out an  faxed back to our offices, we then start the process of payment receipt and  processing.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>How does Payment Work?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">When you are booking a property, depending on how far in  advance you are booking, than 50% is due to confirm and lock in your  dates.&nbsp; That is 50% of the actual rate of the house plus any taxes.&nbsp;  This does not include security deposit which can be paid with the last  payment.&nbsp; The last payment is due 60 days prior to your stay.&nbsp;  Remember that if you are booking last minute than the payment is due in  full.&nbsp; This process has been agreed upon by each owner.&nbsp; Some owners  may fluctuate in case you need a little more time, but if you are having a hard  time getting the final payment in, please contact our offices right away so we  can inform the owners.&nbsp; You do not want to loose your deposit and we are  not liable for your loss.&nbsp; You are responsible in getting your deposits  and final payments into the owners in a timely manner.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>What Kind of Payment do You Accept</strong>?</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">At this time we are accepting personal checks, cashier&rsquo;s  checks, bank transfers, and company checks.&nbsp; We are not accept credit  cards at this time.&nbsp; Unfortunately due to the high risk factors associated  with credit cards we are choosing a responsible alternative to credit  cards.&nbsp; Please note that we verify each cashier&rsquo;s check by digitally  transferring the check to the issuing bank.&nbsp; Any check returned will be  thought of as a missed payment, which puts you at risk of loosing your deposit  or the home you are booking.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Corporate Client&rsquo;s please note when sending a company check  you must include the contact name and phone number as we need to verify the  check has been issued according to your company guidelines.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>When do the Owners get paid?</strong></p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">We do not hold any funds in trust.&nbsp; That means that  once a payment comes in, the owner is paid directly within 5 days of your check  clearing or within hours of your wire coming into our offices.&nbsp; This means  that we are not holding any money that belongs to you.&nbsp; All of your funds  have left our office months prior to your departure.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>What happens if I have an issue at the home upon arrival</strong>?</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">If you have an issue at the home upon arrival, you must  inform the host or management company that will be letting you in.&nbsp; We  highly recommend you view the home or at least know the area and have seen  enough photographs to satisfy your needs.&nbsp; You are renting a BY OWNER  home, we merely market the homes to our fullest capacity for each owner.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>What does the Security Deposit Cover</strong>?</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">A security deposit is what you give to an owner to ensure  the owner that you understand that you must leave the house in the same  condition that you found it.&nbsp; If a cable bill, internet bill, phone bill,  maids bill, or if something is damaged, than the owner reserves the right to  deduct the overages or damages from your security deposit.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify">Security Deposits are normally returned within 30 days of  departure to allow for all bills to come into the home owner and all items to  be checked to ensure nothing has been damaged.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><strong>Why do some owners recommend Travelers Insurance</strong>?</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Travelers Insurance in every sense of the word is for those  who are traveling somewhere and want to make certain that they get their money  back if they need to cancel their trips due to (Death in the Family, Serious  Injury, or Hazardous conditions due to storms in your area that are preventing  you from flying or leaving your area).&nbsp; Please check with your Travelers  Insurance Experts for more information.</p>

              <p align="justify" class="style48">What you should Know About  Vacation Rentals?</p>
              <p align="justify" class="style48">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><em><u>What is a True Vacation Rental</u></em><u> &ndash;</u></p>
              <p align="justify"><strong><em>A True Vacation Rental</em></strong> is a home that is one  that operates under the guidelines of that particular city/state/country Resort  Accommodations Guidelines.&nbsp; A homeowner who is renting their &ldquo;home for  sale&rdquo; under the guise that it is a True Vacation Rental is not being  honest.&nbsp; Owners are charged accommodations taxes which are different for  every state and city within that state/country/district/suburb.&nbsp; Even a  Castle in Ireland pays VAT which is a Vacation Rental or Accommodation  tax.&nbsp; This does not apply to yearly leases, which we do not handle  here.&nbsp; You must use a realtor for an unfurnished yearly lease.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify"><em><u>What is the difference between a listing site and  dreamexoticrentals.com -</u></em></p>
              <p align="justify">A Listing Site is a site where you just post a home and it  can be any home (you have no way of knowing whether that home is for sale, in  foreclosure, partially used by owner, or being rented legally).&nbsp; These  sites do not monitor any of the homes on their sites, these are individuals, or  companies who want to market their homes on their own.&nbsp; These are valuable  sites for marketing purposes but be weary of distinct signs that something is  not quite right.&nbsp; Be sure you get a name of an owner or company, an  address, working phone number, and can verify that the company is doing  business legally or that the owner does not have a criminal record.&nbsp; You  can legally search criminal&nbsp; history on any number of websites that are in  that local city/area.&nbsp; You can also check with the Division of  Corporations to make sure the company is up to standard without serious  complaint.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">It is difficult to be sure who anyone is.&nbsp; That is why we  make certain our owners are all verifiable.&nbsp; We always get various  contacts, check with the cities, check with that state, and country to make  certain that owner/company is legally running a business.&nbsp; The last thing  we want is for you to have a disappointing vacation.&nbsp; Although we can  never be 100% sure that nothing will happen in the future we can always verify  them prior to their listing with us.</p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify">It is good to note that we turn down 40% of the home owners  that contact us.&nbsp; We do not cater to home owners or companies who have bad  reputations under Trip Advisor or with their local Better Business  Companies.&nbsp; It is important for us to maintain a good working relationship  with both our owner and our guest who is inquiring about a home.&nbsp; We are  passionate about what we do and we look forward to feedback about &nbsp;any of  the homes.&nbsp; </p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Unlike Listing Sites we remove any listing that has 1  negative commentary on it.&nbsp; If a home has had a negative comment or  letter, where the owner has shown negligent behavior towards a guest, including  cleanliness, all items in the home in good condition and working order, or rude  behavior towards a client, than we have the absolute right to remove this home  and owner from our system.&nbsp; <strong><em>There is no second chance with our  company, once a home has received a serious negative commentary it&rsquo;s gone!</em></strong></p>
              <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align="justify">Vacation Homes are the new way to travel and we understand  that.&nbsp; See our Pet Friendly site for Pet Friendly homes <a href="http://www.petsgettostay.com" target="_window" class="color"><u>www.petsgettostay.com</u></a>, and if you have  any questions, feel free to call us and speak to anyone here @ 786-293-9061.      </p>
