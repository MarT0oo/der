We pride ourselves in being a "giving" company and we know it's only because of our clients we are able to do this and continue this work.  Our charities range from Animal Foundations to Children's Charities and we always chose wisely.  We have always taken pride in selecting the most deserving of the charities and foundations to work with and because of this we want our clients to know that we care.

							<p>Our mission is to raise awareness of the ever growing plight of homeless animals in this country, both in shelters and those dumped on our streets. Way too many amazing animals are euthanized every single day simply because they are homeless.</p>

							<p>We want to introduce these animals to the public and educate people that unwanted companion animals are not damaged goods or unworthy, but really can be great family pets. Because the abuse, neglect, cruelty and medical cases cost shelters the most money and are the most urgent, they are often the first animals euthanized. It is our goal to focus on the rescue of these urgent animals and provide them immediately the routine, emergency or specialized medical care they need and deserve. We will go beyond just vet care and get these animals rehabilitated as needed using trainers and behaviorists to help overcome issues related to past trauma.</p>

							<p>It is our belief that no injured or abused animal should lose its life simply due to lack of funds. We do not have our own shelter, and we will rely on volunteers, fosters and adopters to take the animals into their homes and provide them with proper care and nurturing.  All of our animals will be vaccinated, heartworm tested, micro-chipped and altered. All of our homes, foster or adopter, will be fully screened, including references and vet check, an interview with the applicant and a home visit to ensure the home is the right fit for the animal.</p>

							<p>Our outreach and education efforts will take place online via Facebook, web site and other social media as well as in person in the community via community events, school assemblies and any place people may lawfully gather to exchange information and learn.</p>

							<p>Our message is one teaching general animal care and welfare, population control through spay and neuter and disease control in the animal population via proper vaccinations.</p>

							<p>Designed and built based on the national best practice model for Child Advocacy Centers, Kristi House’s main facility is centrally located in the Health District of Miami and on major public transportation lines. It is in a prime location for families facing socio-exconomic challenges in the heart of Miami. It is in close proximity to areas with high rates of families experiencing unemployment and other economic hardships, and with high incidences of STDs, teenage pregnancy and youth in need of trauma-informed services. Satellite offices in the north and south, and a centrally located Drop-In Center provide easier neighborhood access for clients.</p>

							<p>Our initiative since 2016 to better serve Deep South Dade—an area in dire need of child sexual abuse and child sex trafficking services—opened an office in Naranja in January 2017, and a Homestead office in early 2019. We have three full-time positions established in Deep South Dade supported by a combination of public grants (SAMHSA, The Children’s Trust) and private foundation support (Florida Blue Foundation, Ocean Reef Community Foundation). The Krys Visionary Challenge enabled the Homestead opening and added transportation route and staff.</p>

							<p><strong>History</strong></p>

							<p>Founded in 1977 by Dr Dame Daphne Sheldrick DBE, in memory of her late husband, famous naturalist and founding Warden of Tsavo East National Park, David Leslie William Sheldrick MBE, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust claims a rich and deeply rooted family history in wildlife and conservation.  In 1948, David Sheldrick began his renowned career within the Royal National Parks of Kenya, where he worked unwaveringly for over two decades transforming Tsavo, a previously unchartered and inhospitable land, into Kenya’s largest and most famous National Park. David Sheldrick stands out, even today, as one of Africa’s most famous and proficient pioneer National Park Wardens.</p>

							<p>For over 25 years Kenya-born Daphne Sheldrick lived and worked alongside David, during which time they raised and successfully rehabilitated many wild species.  Daphne Sheldrick’s involvement with wildlife spanned a lifetime, and she was a recognized international authority on the rearing of wild creatures and was the first person to perfect the milk formula and husbandry needed to successfully raise infant milk-dependent Elephants and Rhinos.</p>

							<p>Since the death of her husband, Daphne, and her family, lived and worked in the Nairobi National Park where they built The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust and its pioneering Orphans’ Project into the global force for wildlife conservation that is today. Daphne's daughter Angela worked alongside her mother running the Trust for twenty years, and since Daphne’s passing in 2018 continues the mission with passion and vigor ably supported by her husband Robert Carr-Hartley, their two sons Taru and Roan and the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust team.</p>

							<p><strong>Ambition</strong></p>

							<p>As the human population expands, pushing wildlife to the very brink of extinction and wild habitats to the edge of destruction, the Sheldrick Trust is determined to reverse the effects of the past and prevent the effects of the present, in the hope for a better future for both wildlife and mankind. Since its inception the Sheldrick Trust has delivered outstanding results by leading the way in single-species conservation, and in doing so, has evolved into a multi-dimensional conservation body ready to meet the growing challenges faced by Kenya's threatened wildlife and habitats.</p>

							<p>The long term goal of the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is to secure safe havens for wildlife, through the effective management and protection of key ecosystems and wilderness areas in Kenya.  Through close working partnerships with the Kenya Wildlife Service, the custodians of Kenya's wildlife, the Kenya Forest Service and local communities, the Trust can, and is, taking the lead in securing vast tracks of land for wildlife.</p>

							<p>Since October of 2013, we are a Street Crew rescue whose goal is to rescue stray dogs that are injured, sick or that are in imminent danger and need immediate medical attention. DPC responds to emergency calls from animal loving Detroit residents, workers, DTE workers, Consumers workers, Detroit Police, Highland Park Police…. that see a stray dog in a life and death situation that are in desperate need of help.  Some of these dogs living on the streets have been hit by cars, used as bait from dog fighting, shot, burned, sick or emaciated. Almost every dog that we rescue has extensive medical issues and is extremely injured, which makes us a unique rescue.</p>

							<p>DPC responds to emergency calls from animal loving Detroit residents, workers, DTE workers, Consumers workers, Detroit Police and Highland Park Police that see a stray dog in a life and death situation that are in desperate need of our help. Some of these stray dogs living on the streets have been hit by cars, used as bait from dog fighting, shot, burned, sick or emaciated. Almost every stray dog that we rescue has extensive medical issues and is extremely injured, which makes us a unique rescue.</p>

							<p>The first stop for every dog we rescue is the veterinary hospital where the dog is treated for their injuries and their health assessed. Once our rescued dogs are medically cleared, fully vetted, spayed/neutered then they are fostered to get them acclimated in a warm loving home environment. Then they are transferred to one of our many partner organizations to be adopted into a forever home.</p>

							<p>DPC has no paid employees, just a small group of dedicated volunteers. We operate solely on donations, which enables us to rescue thousands of helpless dogs off the streets of Detroit. Our street crew covers the entire Detroit area, which is 139 square miles and is one of the most dangerous cities America. Everyday we rescue dogs out of horrible extreme conditions that are unfathomable to most people. There is nothing more rewarding than seeing these poor helpless dogs get off the streets and get into a safe, warm, happy forever home that they deserve. These dogs are getting a second chance in life, which is the reason our crew works hard seven days a week. But our awesome supporters are a huge part of saving these lives too. We couldn’t rescue without you.</p>
