								 <h4>Chateau de Farcheville, Bouville, France Vacation Rental</h4>

<p>It is as if Chateau de Farcheville is surrounded by an invisibility shield. Even the locals say they have driven by it for years without knowing it was there. And for the lucky few who have ventured past its slowly opening gates, there is an imminent feeling of “going down the rabbit hole”. And rightly so, because once inside this 25 acre hidden estate, it’s like having entered into one’s own private Wonderland. Exploring the chateau’s 48,800 sqf of living space and 10 hectare garden is a marvel. It’s halls, salons, theater, moat, roof top, chapel, pool and spa, gardens, lakes and suites. The concealed doorways, hidden passages and secret rooms. The underground wine cellar and Medieval prison cells. The castle has never been open to the public. It is surrounded by a walled garden enveloped by 420 hectares of its own land. Chateau de Farcheville is one of the most beautiful moated Medieval castles in France and it has been restored to perfection by highly creative and sophisticated owners. The experience of Chateau de Farcheville is one of cheer fantasy, exhilaration, luxury, exclusivity and privacy.</p>

<p>Chateau de Farcheville is only a 45 minute drive from Paris, yet it feels like a secret, private island. The heli-pad and 24-hour state-of-the-art security systems help to make it the perfect get-away for the most private and distinguished guests. The chateau is upgraded to the highest standard of modern comfort and luxury without compromising the integrity of its medieval history and architecture. The interior decoration of the castle reflects a harmonious blend of styles, from the rigorous decorum of the 12th century to the rich decoration of the second empire. A visit here is like a visit to the Versailles, except you get to sleep in the beds. For the curious and the aficionados, one can ask to be shown the many concealed doors and secret rooms hidden within this elegant chateau. Becoming privy to secret rooms so secret that they are hidden inside other, already hidden secret rooms, or descending into the 13th century hidden chamber under a pond in the garden is like being served a heaping spoonful of giddy exhilaration. And if you would like to add some chills to that, just venture down into the Medieval dungeons to have a look at “le skelet”.</p>

<p>Chateau de Farcheville has 22 bedrooms and 34 bathrooms. 12 of the bedrooms are “en-suite”. Each suite is beautifully unique in color, style and furnishings. The Grand Suite is the biggest of them all and takes up almost and entire wing of the chateau. It has a private elevator, a 600 sqf master bathroom, salons, libraries and entire floors of “his” and “hers” closets and dressing rooms fit for nothing less than royalty. Also mentionable is the King’s suite and the Queen’s suite in the East wing. They are both designed in tradition with being reserved for the exclusive use of the King of France should His Majesty ever visit the castle. The King’s suite occupies two floors and is decorated with incredible wood carvings reminiscent of Viking art. The bathroom is topped off by a dragon perched atop a large silver bath tub delivering bath water from its mouth.</p>

<p>Chateau de Farcheville can accommodate almost any event. Whether it is a private celebration or a medieval banquet, a themed party or corporate entertainment. There is the “Great Hall” of spectacular dimensions and painted walls. With its adjacent rooms and facilities, the Great Hall can easily welcome one hundred or more seated guests. Besides the chateau’s three beautiful kitchens from different centuries there is also a modern, professional kitchen adjacent to the Great hall. This is where Chateau de Farcheville’s Michelin-star-rated chef Aymeric Dreux and his team cooks for guests of the chateau.</p>

<p>Weddings can take place in the beautiful Medieval chapel consecrated in 1304 and located in the enclosed cobble stone inner courtyard. For outdoor weddings there is the “Nymphea” in the shape of half moon lake skirted by pergolas in the garden behind the chateau.</p>

<p>Other highlights the chateau offers for its guests to enjoy are:</p>

<h4>The Spa.</h4>

<p>There is a 19th century building on the far side of the castle moat that is totally dedicated to sports and relaxation. It features a spectacular 80 foot long indoor heated pool. A gym and a spa with a hammam (steam room) and six treatment rooms for massage and other spa services. Next to the pool is an oriental tea-room, an exotic garden and a meditation room.</p>

<h4>The Theatre.</h4>

<p>A beautiful round theatre clad top to bottom in royal blue velvet. The theatre is two stories and has 24 luxurious, full lounge chair seats. It’s fully equipped for concerts, small stage performances and movie screenings. There is an artist changing and make up room. The dedicated projection room houses modern equipment to facilitate top of the line movie projection in HD with THX sound.</p>

<h4>The Pigeonnier</h4>

<p>This large dove cot looks like a small tower and sits in the middle of a pond. A small drawbridge leads to it across the water. It has a kitchen and restrooms and a beautiful room at the top now dedicated as a “music room”</p>

<h4>The Flower Garden</h4>

<p>In the spring this three acre 18th century garden is in full bloom and makes for a wonderful, beautiful and fragrant walk.</p>

<p>Other games and sports offered are tennis courts, a billiard room, and a board-game room. There are two libraries, a conference room, and several dining rooms and reception rooms through out the chateau. The South wing of the castle has six bedrooms and bathrooms that can either be used as additional bedrooms for guests or as dedicated staff’s quarters.</p>

<p>The chateau is fully staffed including a butler, maids, chef, security, gardeners and handy men. The personnel staff do not live inside the chateau. Guests are welcome to bring any additional staff of their own if they so please.</p>

<p>There are three “guardian houses” at the North, South and East corners of the chateau property (which is 25 acres). Didier, lives in one of them. Born at the castle and having been its guardian all his life, he is always around in case help is needed for any reason. The 2nd guardian house is dedicated for the hostess that will take care of the party of guests in their own language. The third guardian house is open to be occupied by additional security personnel.</p>
