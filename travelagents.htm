      <p><strong><em>What is a Travel Partner?</em></strong><br><br>A <strong><em>Travel Partner</em></strong> is someone who works in Association with  you, a supplier or a vendor, someone in your field or that&nbsp; has an area of  specialty in travel that you may be in need of.&nbsp; A Travel Partner is  someone that can help make your business better by working in conjunction with  you and not in competition with you.&nbsp; We are after the same thing, to make  the client as happy as possible, by offering quality villas worldwide that meet  and exceed their needs.&nbsp; We do this by hand picking our villa selection  and having wonderful report with owners and management companies.&nbsp; This  makes it that much easier for us to work together.&nbsp; Simply put, we want  you to feel confident that we will never go behind your back, we will always  keep you first.&nbsp; If your client calls us direct and we have your client on  file, we tell them that they need to speak to their agent directly.&nbsp; We  can also commission you out if they book, whichever you decide is fine with us.<br><br><strong><em>The Commission Structure is simple. </em></strong>&nbsp;We work on a split  commission basis, so if we get 10% than you get 5%, if we get 20% than you get  10%, this is really the only way to work.&nbsp; You are supplying a customer  and we are supplying an accommodation.&nbsp; This is a process that has worked  with our other agents and has proven to be successful.&nbsp; When this does not  work is when our agents try and negotiate directly with the owners by either  trying to go around us and form a relationship or trying to get the client to  go direct and form a relationship, this never works out.&nbsp; If you are found  to be doing this, we immediately stop our relationship with you and you are put  on our list of agents not to work with.&nbsp; This is something that is  unfortunate but has happened before and forces our hand in this matter. &nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>When do you get paid?</em></strong>&nbsp; If you refer a client to our offices and we are  booking a villa for your client, when we receive payment, than you receive your  commission no more than 10 days later.&nbsp; Our agents are very important to  us and we understand you are doing the work as well as we, so we make sure you  are paid for your efforts.&nbsp; The only reason this would not happen is if  the Villa, Castle, Chalet, Private Home, Lodge or private resort does not allow  for&nbsp; us to deduct our commission.&nbsp; If that is the case we will let  you know and this most often happens when the villa is a privately managed high  end villa that may have a commission in excess of 10,000 Dollars.&nbsp; The  owners protect themselves by only paying when the client has paid in full and  has arrived at their villa safely.&nbsp; We are then paid upon departure of the  client.&nbsp; This is however VERY RARE and should not be considered the norm  in this industry.<br><br><strong><em>May we list your villas or products on our site?</em></strong>&nbsp; Please ask us  for the information for the villas you would like to have on your site, we must  obtain permission for some, but most will allow for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><strong><em>How does the pricing work?</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see pricing  on our website, as well as photos, feel free to grab them from the site or ask  for a Brochure from one of our agents.&nbsp; Once you receive the brochure you  can send it along.&nbsp; The rates are on the site and not hidden.&nbsp; You  can change the name of the villa if you prefer, but remember that this is not  necessary as we are working together.&nbsp; Your client will be noted and you  will be contacted if they try to book direct.&nbsp; We are very cautious about  this.&nbsp; Pricing is not inclusive of any taxes, security deposits, or final  cleaning fees.&nbsp; Additional items such as maid, chef, and spa services  should be inquired about, unless the villa says “Fully Catered.”<br><br><strong><em>How can we get started?</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are a Travel Agent,  Concierge, Travel Advisor, or a Travel Coordinator all you would need to do is  fill out our form and return it. &nbsp;We also require a W9 from new Vendors  which is for our accounting office.&nbsp; If you are an international agency we  require your tax id or business license or your personal tax id for the  paperwork submission.&nbsp; We do this in accordance with tax law so that we  are not left with a &nbsp;tax liability.&nbsp; This is in accordance with our  office and regulations for businesses doing business in the USA.&nbsp; We are  happy to work with any Travel Professional, all you need do is ask.&nbsp;  <strong><a href="downloads/TAPartnerAgreement.pdf"><em>Please fax the paperwork back at your earliest convenience.</em></a></strong><br><br><strong><em>How do we reach you to book?</em></strong>&nbsp; We are here every day via  phone (786) 293-9061 or if you are in the USA (866) 293-9061 from 9:30AM – 7PM  EST.&nbsp; But you can reach us <a href="contact.htm">by email</a> and we will answer earlier and later  from&nbsp; our home offices and not our physical office.&nbsp; From our  Physical office we will reply within office hours. <br><br><strong><em>Languages Spoken?</em></strong>&nbsp; We speak Spanish, English, Portuguese, but we  have agents that can assist with Russian, Italian, French, and German.&nbsp; So  please feel free to email in any language, please let us know if you need to  speak to someone in your native language for assistance.<br><br>We look forward to working with you!&nbsp; Welcome Aboard!</p>
