          <p><strong>Traveling  to Canada</strong><br><br>There are  many wonders in the world, many beautiful sites to see, but if get a chance you  must visit Canada.&nbsp; Known for its mountainous regions to the West, where  you’ll find Whistler Mountain (British Colombia) one of the best ski  destinations in the World, offering you the experience of a lifetime.&nbsp; The  stars often come out during the winter and you never know who you’re going to  see. Also try the Black Diamond on Lake Louise, we hear it’s one of the best,  and fiercest thrills you’ll ever have.&nbsp; British Colombia offers other  great adventures as well, such as Whale Watching (in Vancouver and Victoria),  Discover Dog Sledding in Quesnel Lake (experience nature in a different way),  Powel River (for it’s great history), Kootenay Rockies (offers some amazing hot  springs), Vancouver (for its city lights and sounds), or just take a tour and  get to know the history of the aboriginal ancestry.&nbsp; And don’t forget home  to the 2010 Winter Games!<br><br>To the East  &nbsp;you have Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick on the Coast.&nbsp;  This area offers amazing history, having one of the oldest known settlements in  Canada and offering visitors a beautiful gleaming coral sand.&nbsp; It’s a  lovely place to visit if you are looking to travel during summer months.&nbsp;  Additionally you can dive off the Bay of Fundy, Golf on Cape Breton Island,  Visit Anne of Green Gables Home, See nature and take a tour of the local  wildlife (maybe see a Black Bear or in the distance spot a beautiful Killer  Whale).&nbsp; No matter where you go on the Coast, it will be memorable.<br><br>You can  Experience the North where ½ of the people are aboriginal and get a glimpse  back in history.&nbsp; The Northern Territories also draw a crowd of tourists  looking to experience the Aurora, where the lights seem to dance at  night.&nbsp; The travel here can be a little shaky, so getting a guide is a  great idea.&nbsp; In Central Canada you have all of the Great Metropolitan  Cities: Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Niagra Falls and so much more.&nbsp;  These cities offer a range of shopping, dining, and experiences.&nbsp; From the  Toronto Film Festival to the Shaw Festival in Niagra and then the International  de Jazz Festival of Montreal.&nbsp; <br><br>We offer  great Chalets for Skiing, Cottages, Homes on the Beach, luxury villas, and more  for the Canadian Traveler. </p>
