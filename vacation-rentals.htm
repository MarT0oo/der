                <p>Worldwide Holiday Vacation Rentals           <br><br>Having a Vacation Rental anywhere in the world  is a big investment, both of your personal time and of your finances.&nbsp; It  can be for some a wonderful experience and for others quite a different  experience, let&rsquo;s just call it &ldquo;the elephant in the room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most people  find themselves within the situation of buying a vacation rental because they  have money to invest and they have always wanted to invest in real estate.  Instead of buying and then selling, the decide to buy in a location they like,  possibly because they too will use the property.&nbsp; Then they begin the  process of elimination and finally they purchase the house.&nbsp; Most of us wouldn&rsquo;t  realize that this is just the start of what is to become the rental, there is  much more to this process than meets the eye.<br><br>When an owner purchases a home there are a  series of things that happen, no matter where they live.&nbsp; They have to set  the house up to pay the Government, City Taxes, or country taxes on a Transient  (short term) rental.&nbsp; This is usually handled by the owners, but if you  decide to use a property manager than they can assist with this process.&nbsp;  Once you get the paperwork filed then you need insurance, to insure the renter  in the house and to designate it as a rental home.&nbsp; This way if something  happens your vacationer will be covered and you will be covered.&nbsp; These  are two things we highly encourage and without setting the house up correctly you  may run into a big problem, which typically means fines and removal from the  rental pool.<br><br>Now after you&rsquo;ve done all the buying, setting  up the paperwork and designating it, there comes the next phase, which is the  furnishing and updating of the house.&nbsp; Most people have no idea how  important this is and most people we&rsquo;ve had the luxury of working with are open  to our suggestions. So we&rsquo;ve compiled some very good ideas for our owners,  especially those looking to attract a luxury buyer, so that you can get more  bookings.</p>
      <p>Updating<br><br>Does the house you just bought need a lot of  updating?&nbsp; Are you thinking of putting it off? &nbsp;The only way to put  off updating is if the things to be updated are not that important, things that  only you would notice, like a closet being too small or a window being a little  worn.&nbsp; If the things you are thinking of waiting on are old kitchen, old  appliances, air conditioning units on their way out, flooring that is old and  dingy and bathrooms that are old and tired, than you&rsquo;re making a HUGE ROOKY  MISTAKE.&nbsp; <br><br>You cannot cover up the imperfection that is  the Guts of the entire house, with some paint and a few pieces of  furniture.&nbsp; If a client walks into a house that has old kitchens and  flooring, the first thing they will do is complain.&nbsp; In fact most of our  complaints, come from the very things owners should update first: Air  conditioning, Bathrooms, and Kitchens.&nbsp; This will be what a family will  continue to complain about until the day they depart, making your life, or the  life of the manager, stressful and awkward.&nbsp; <br><br>The first things you should do if buying a  home that is affordable yet &ldquo;needs work&rdquo; is make the changes, right away.&nbsp;  You should invest in nice flooring, kitchen cabinets and preferably granite  counters. If you cannot afford all of this and your cabinets are in good shape,  simply reface your cabinets and add granite or a high grade granite look  alike.&nbsp; The bathrooms should always have nice tile work (new) and not  dingy and stained, nice tubs (not dingy and stained) and be painted a neutral  color (tan or light brown) to give them very Resort Like Feels.&nbsp; You never  want a bright blue or pink bathroom, a high level client does not want to  cringe at using a bathroom so that&rsquo;s a bad idea.&nbsp; All rooms should really  have a pleasing and neutral paint, with white baseboards.&nbsp; <br><br>After you&rsquo;ve done your work on the bones of  the house, we want you to really think about what type of vacation you&rsquo;re  selling.&nbsp; Is this a luxury home in a luxury location?&nbsp; If so, do not  even think about adding whicker to any part of the house, not even the  exterior.&nbsp; Although I highly believe that is the ONLY place whicker should  even be considered.&nbsp; Whicker should never be someone&rsquo;s living or dining  area, that is not only really a bad idea, but it also makes renters stay  away.&nbsp; You are not looking to sacrifice making good money over a few  hundred dollar decision.&nbsp; Your house, now a neutral color, with nice  floors and amenities, should use this basic model for design.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br><strong>Model 1 – The Family Traveler</strong></p>
      <p>If you are renting a family home, maybe in  Orlando or near a Theme Park Somewhere, there are a few tips to consider.&nbsp;  People with children want to keep them entertained, so if you didn&rsquo;t buy a  house with a pool that was a wrong choice.&nbsp; A house with a pool will  always rent better.&nbsp; Secondly, people with children will always like a  game room.&nbsp; A game room is usually a space that an owner designated for  the Billiard Table, a Television, some video consoles and some DVD&rsquo;s to chose  from.&nbsp; This will be an important feature for Family Travelers.&nbsp; Aside  from that having a nice crib, a pack and play, and a high chair are also a great  idea.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t have them, they will ask for them.&nbsp; Better to  prepare than to be caught off guard.&nbsp; The last important feature for a  family traveler is&nbsp; having a list of area hospitals and family doctors,  just in case someone gets sick. &nbsp;This usually happens with people who  travel a long distance and have toddlers, the stress of the flight, coupled  with a new environment, makes for the perfect combination for illness.&nbsp;  Most parents are aware of this so they like to have those items at hand. &nbsp;<br><br>Setting up the bedrooms in Model 1 is  easy.&nbsp; You should have at least 1 King (master) 1 or 2 Queens and the 3rd  or 4th rooms should have two twin beds for kids or two bunk beds  (but nice quality). &nbsp;The kids rooms should have a Television and movies  and/or game console.&nbsp; The living area should be ample, large sofa and have  a great surround sound system.&nbsp; The kitchen table should seat at least  8-10 if not more and you should always hide a folding table somewhere just in  case.&nbsp; The kitchen should have at least 12 dishes, 12 cups, 12 coffee  mugs, 12 bowls, 4 frying pans 4 pots, 4 pans and enough cutlery for 12  guests.&nbsp; As well you will need at least 12 wine glasses for your guests.</p>
      <p><br />
        Keeping at least 6 towels (preferably white  and plush) for each bathroom is a must, hand towels as well should be  included.&nbsp; However I never like to include a wash cloth, that is  unsanitary and should never be something a client asks for, if they were to ask  for it than you would dispose of it afterwards. &nbsp;You never know what goes  on a washcloth and I wouldn&rsquo;t want that on my face or body after a stranger had  used it on something personal.</p>
      <p>You are all set with Family Traveler</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br><strong>Model 2 – The Beach Vacation</strong></p>
      <p>Ah the beach, a place where people go to get  away from it all.&nbsp; Whether it&rsquo;s the Caribbean or French Riviera or your  local beach, it&rsquo;s really just the idea of the lovely ocean and sunsets. This  type of house, although you will feel like coloring the walls with the rainbow,  DON&rsquo;T DO IT!&nbsp; Whatever makes people feel like they should paint their homes  like their children&rsquo;s elementary projects&nbsp; has got to change. Nobody who  is walking into a vacation home wants to see this, in fact it doesn&rsquo;t say  &ldquo;relaxation&rdquo; it says &ldquo;a crazy person lives here.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that is not what  we&rsquo;re selling to a luxury traveler.&nbsp; So when you are objectively looking  at furnishing and painting your home you should think of a Luxury Beachside  Resort and not of a tiki bar.<br><br>That being said the same will apply for  paint.&nbsp; A nice muted beige or the lightest of yellows (LIGHT) being the  word here, is what we need.&nbsp; The bedrooms should be decorated resort  style, with plush mattresses and lovely pillows and white sheets and a light  colored white or contemporary comforter.&nbsp; Remember when buying a comforter  that you don&rsquo;t want something that is going to stain easily.&nbsp; Buy high end  or keep buying new ones every month.&nbsp; The towels in the bathrooms (6 in  each) should be plush and welcoming, there should be a flat screen television  in each room and if&nbsp; you have a master patio there should always be a nice  sitting area for the guests.&nbsp; You should leave a lovely sea scent in the  rooms, something welcoming.&nbsp; Have some amazing bamboo art or natural  fibers hanging around.&nbsp; Give the house the feel of the inside coming into  the house, but in a very nice and comforting way.&nbsp; Remember STAY AWAY FROM  LOUD colors.&nbsp; <br><br>The living area should be a nice comfortable  sofa, not leather but a nice fabric.&nbsp; NO one wants to sit on leather after  they have been sweating all day long at the beach and you don&rsquo;t want to replace  those sofas every year.&nbsp; So a nice fabric, that breathes easy, some nice  furnishings maybe in a washed wood, with a dramatic look, and some great art  throughout.&nbsp; The house should feel like a cottage on the beach, A 5 STAR  cottage.&nbsp; The kitchen should again have all we mentioned above, as well as  more plastic cups as we will be using them for barbeques outside.&nbsp; This  house will need a grille and outside eating area.&nbsp; If on the beach you do  not need a pool but if you are not on the beach and do not have a pool that is  a big NO NO.&nbsp; You need one or the other for the beach home rentals.&nbsp;  You will also need, in closing for this section, a great set of beach towels,  at least 15.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br><strong>Model 3 – The Ski Rental</strong></p>
      <p>Now that it&rsquo;s come time to go skiing, it&rsquo;s  time to get down to business.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s start with décor on this one right  away.&nbsp; If your Chalet, Cottage or Home are too far from the slopes you  will get very few if any request.&nbsp; This is just to get started so you  know.&nbsp; The ski homes main function is to serve as a home base for the  skiing family or to serve as the summer base for nature lovers and  hikers.&nbsp; The house should come well stocked with ski racks, heated  flooring, and should emanate the idea of skiing and nature.&nbsp; The décor  should be solid and/or contemporary.&nbsp; Some owners have switched from the  heavy European feeling décor to a more Crate and Barrel Style of furnishings,  which seems to work well for the traveler.&nbsp; This style can be a mix of  hard wood tables with a more contemporary chair or a very heavy wood bed with  contemporary accents, no matter which way you chose the color scheme is always  the same.&nbsp; Dark Colors on furnishings work best, leather sofas work best,  you need a game room with billiards table and you absolutely need a bar area or  something that functions as a bar area.&nbsp; The kitchen should have  everything we&rsquo;ve discussed, including but not limited to all the dishes and  glassware, but in addition this house should offer a tea kettle for hot  chocolate and some really amazing large mugs for drinking their morning  coffee.&nbsp; <br><br>Most people would prefer as well to have a way  to get to the lifts, so please provide either a golf cart or something they can  easily get around in. &nbsp;If you do not have this, than try leaving the  numbers to the carriers that pass by that route to pick up skiers.&nbsp; If you  are walking distance, even better.&nbsp; Upon arrival the skiing family will  want to find themselves warm, so always make sure to have instructions for the  heater and fireplace. &nbsp;If it&rsquo;s a wood fireplace make sure to leave some  wood and if it&rsquo;s electric than make sure to leave instructions.&nbsp; <br><br>The kids rooms should have bunk beds or  similar, but upscale not cheesy.&nbsp; The Guest rooms should have King Beds  for Adults, most people skiing want room to move around.&nbsp; So at least 2 or  3 kings and then 1 Queen and the rest can be Bunk Beds for singles or  kids.&nbsp; Make sure the comforters are plush and the sheets are high level  cotton, do not let a skier sleep on polyester, this would be a bad idea and  fairly uncomfortable.&nbsp; <br><br>And last but not least, a Jacuzzi is an  absolute must!&nbsp; If you do not have a Jacuzzi it may just break the deal,  so don&rsquo;t forget to buy one.&nbsp; <br><br>There are other &ldquo;Luxury Models&rdquo; I have not  included.&nbsp; That would be the Mansion Model and the Fully Catered Model.  &nbsp;Here are just a few ideas below.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br><strong>The Mansion Model</strong></p>
      <p>So you purchased a Mansion, that&rsquo;s  great.&nbsp; Now the first thing to note is like other homes, you need to be  sure your interior and your décor meet the standard of the vacationer.&nbsp; A  Mansion renter is going to require much more than your ordinary family.&nbsp;  This renter is a well traveled person with very refined taste and they don&rsquo;t  want to be stuck in a home they dislike for any reason. So you have to be extra  careful with this traveler because if you fail to please they will leave.<br><br>The main idea here is that EVERYTHING needs to  be perfect.&nbsp; And when I mean everything, I even mean your gardening.&nbsp;  I cannot explain enough how much a mansion fails if it is not landscaped  well.&nbsp; Landscaping gives the feel of luxury and says you care about the  house, if at this point you&rsquo;re thinking about this, than you need to get your  landscaping done.&nbsp; The client will want to enter a house and feel &ldquo;amazed&rdquo;  and not scared.&nbsp; The floors if hardwood should always be cleaned and  polished.&nbsp; The floors if marble or travertine should be checked for stains  and nicks.&nbsp; The paint should be crisp and not be painted a multitude of  colors, tans, sands, whites and off whites, work best in mansions.&nbsp; The  style today is Modern with a touch of Asian and a touch of nature.&nbsp; You do  not want to overdo the &ldquo;theme&rdquo; and you do not want to give a client the reason  NOT to sit on your sofa. It should be modern but welcoming.&nbsp; Remember a  white sofa is NEVER a good idea unless it&rsquo;s leather and treated.&nbsp; White is  a color that stains easy so stick with a tan or neutral color.&nbsp; There  should always be a flat screen television hanging from the Media Rooom/TV room  Wall, when there is not, there is a problem.&nbsp; Nobody wants a tube TV in a  Mansion.&nbsp; So update this part of the house or lose a client base.&nbsp; No  Carpeting is needed, please remove all Asian Carpets from your modern décor, it  does NOT go with the theme and creates an eyesore not a complimentary  accessory.&nbsp; Lots of light, lots of great pieces can easily be found at any  upscale furniture store.&nbsp; If on a budget try City Furniture or something  like that.&nbsp; <br><br>The bedrooms should be platform or platform  like, if going for the contemporary feel.&nbsp; There should be lots of great  variation in height in the room and nice art pieces.&nbsp; Never leave a house  too bare, it just says&nbsp; you don&rsquo;t&nbsp; have money. In your dining area,  stay away from glass or stainless or metal.&nbsp; A nice Wood table with High  Back Chairs and low level lighting (modern) will do the trick.&nbsp; This  creates a great feeling without adding the element of &ldquo;odd&rdquo; into the room.<br><br>For your accessories always try for beautiful  color to add to the white, some lovely vases, some lovely floor pieces, some  great paintings, will all make this mansion pop.&nbsp; Outside a nicely done  patio with a welcoming summer kitchen, heated pool, and lovely loungers just  rounds it all out.<br><br>Dishes should be of highest quality as should  all accessories in a mansion.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br><strong>Fully Catered Model</strong></p>
      <p>A fully catered house means a house that has a  staff.&nbsp; One big thing about the Fully Catered house is how you treat the  guests.&nbsp; As staff should never be overwhelming or inside every room all  the time.&nbsp; They should help with unpacking, gathering groceries, putting  groceries away, cooking, and making the house feel like a hotel. &nbsp;Ask the  guests how many hours they need them, make a very timed arrangement, as not to  disturb the clients while they want their privacy.&nbsp; <br><br>As well this should be a house that has an  element of luxury, so it will match the mansion model for the most part.&nbsp;  So be sure the staff is also able to communicate in their languages, have a  concierge to help the client make reservations and be sure to get a grocery  list prior to arrival.&nbsp; <br><br>There is so much more than meets the eye to  buying and renting a vacation home.&nbsp; If you need help, let us know.&nbsp; </p>
